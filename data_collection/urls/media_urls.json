The article itself also contains highly emotional wording such as this: “The GOP’s battle to destroy everything that’s great about America is gaining more momentum than ever the longer Pres. Donald Trump and his ilk are running the country. The latest effort by a GOP candidate: make Americans and North Carolinians dumber by eliminating the Department of Education (DOE).” Although this story is highly biased against the right it is properly sourced. In reviewing multiple articles, most follow the same format of a clickbait headline that leads to an emotionally charged article that is sourced to factual information.

It was founded in 1980 by American media proprietor Ted Turner as a 24-hour cable news channel; however, by April 2016, a CNN executive officially described the channel as “no longer a TV news network” and instead as “a 24-hour global multi-platform network.” CNN has multiple international stations covering all regions of the world. CNN has been inaccurately criticized as being fake news by President Trump and many of his supporters.\nFunded by / Ownership\nCNN is owned by the Turner Broadcasting System (AT&T – Time Warner). The television stations and website is funded through cable subscriptions and an advertising model.\nAnalysis / Bias\nCNN has a left bias in story selection that often favors the left while being critical of the right. For example, during the 2016 Presidential Election Pew Research concluded that the majority of CNN stories covering President Donald Trump were negative. While less dramatic, Pew also determined that more stories were negative toward Presidential candidate Mitt Romney in 2012.\nCNN typically utilizes loaded emotional words in sensational headlines such as this: Trump pounces on Justice Department report findings. CNN usually sources its news properly through credible reporters/journalists and through hyperlinking to credible media sources. However, CNN has failed numerous fact checks from Politifact. It should be noted that these fact checks were almost exclusively from guests on their numerous talk shows and not from the reporting of actual news, which tends to be factual. Further, CNN has retracted published stories that have been deemed as lacking evidence.\nOverall, we rate CNN left biased based on story selection that often favors the left. We rate them Mixed for factual reporting due to misinformation and failed fact checks from guests and pundits. However, CNN’s straight news reporting would earn a High rating for factual reporting.

It has since published widely read articles and zines for the anarchist movement and distributed posters and books of its own publication. We rate CrimethInc. left biased based on their political opposition to capitalism and advocacy for workers. These political positions are considered left wing in today’s political environment. CWC does use occasional emotional language, but all information is well sourced and linked to facts. (D. Van Zandt 5/7/2017)",

The Daily Beast was founded in 2008 by magazine editor, columnist, and talk-show host Tina Brown. In 2010, The Daily Beast and Newsweek merged in a joint venture and was named The Newsweek Daily Beast Company, which lasted for 2 years. In 2013, Editor-in-Chief and founder Tina Brown announced her departure. John Avlon then became Editor-in-Chief. He was the former associate editor for The New York Sun and speechwriter for former New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani. In May of 2018, Avlon announced his departure from The Daily Beast. Currently, Noah Shachtman, who was co-founder and editor of Wired magazine’s national security blog Danger Room, serves as the new Editor-in-Chief. Heather Dietrick serves as the CEO. You can view the masthead here. \nFunded by / Ownership\nThe Daily Beast’s parent company is IAC (InterActiveCorp). which is run by Barry Diller, who had led the creation of the Fox network. IAC’s CEO is, Joey Levin. IAC (InterActiveCorp) is a media and Internet company comprised of some of the world’s well known brands such as HomeAdvisor, Vimeo, About.com, Dictionary.com, Investopedia and more. The Daily Beast is primarily funded through online advertising.\nAnalysis / Bias\nAccording to a Washington Post article, Editor-in-Chief Noah Shachtman describes how he will improve the Daily Beast. He states “I want us to lean harder into who we are”, explaining further “That means that if the Daily Beast is in the business of scoops — more scoops. “If we’re painting in bright colors now, I want to paint even brighter.”\nIn review, the Daily Beast tends to publish left leaning stories utilizing sensationalized headlines with emotionally loaded words such as “No, Rudy: Trump Isn’t Othello. He’s Iago” and “Imagine a Trump Who Could Constrain Himself and Just Talk About the Economy.” However, they do typically source the info in their reports by using credible sources such as Reuters, PBS, Slate, NY Times as well as sourcing themselves. \nA factual search reveals that the Daily Beast has failed a fact check, however when brought to their attention, they issued a correction to the story. By issuing a correction they remain High for factual reporting.\nOverall, we rate the Daily Beast Left-Biased due to story selection that favors the left and High for factual reporting based on proper sourcing.

In reviewing fact checks we could not find any instance where EI directly failed a fact check from major fact checking sources. We did however find a case where EI refuted a pants on fire claim from Politifact that stated the Baltimore police were trained by Mossad. In their rebuttle, EI is careful to indicate that Mossad did not directly train the Baltimore Police, however they refute that there are not connections based on the defensive style they were trained in and the fact the police had visited Israel twice for training. In the end, Politifact is correct that it is unproven Mossad trained the Baltimore Police, but EI makes a compelling, well sourced rebuttal that there are connections to Israel. The issue with this exchange is the misleading headline used by EI: PolitiFact denies Israeli ties to Baltimore police despite evidence. Politifact’s fact check did not ask if there were Israeli ties, it centered purely on Mossad. Based on this misleading headline, I would rate EI as somewhat mixed for factual reporting despite the use of excellent sourcing in most articles and left biased based on story selection and wording that sometimes amounts to propaganda .

He cites Noam Chomsky as a major influence on his thinking and writing.\nFunded by / Ownership\nThe website is owned by Jeremy Hammond and is funded through online advertising.\nAnalysis / Bias\nForeign Policy Journal republishes articles, essays, viewpoints written by activists and academics from a progressive standpoint, such as the articles of Professor Richard A. Falk, American professor emeritus of international law at Princeton University, “Renaming the 1948 War: Partition, Dispossession, and Fragmentation.”\nIn review, their articles cover various topics that range from the environment, “Can Architecture Fix Our Health, Minds, Societies, Environment?“ to TV documentary critics, “PBS’s Vietnam Acknowledges Nixon’s Treason.” When it comes to economic matters they are not highly critical of the Trump Administration, but instead are critical of the overall system as evidenced by this quote from the article “in the Great Western Democracies, economic policy only serves the hyper-rich and the hyper-powerful. Citizens simply do not count. They are as nothing.“ Foreign Policy Journal also publishes conspiracy theories and pseudoscience such as anti-vaxx propaganda and 9-11 conspiracies.\nEditorially, Foreign Policy Journal is progressive on international geopolitics, diplomacy, and military matters. When it comes to news analysis they use loaded language both in their headlines and the body of the article such as “The Myth of the U.N. Creation of Israel.” However, they utilize credible sources such as un.org , avalon.law.yale.edu and Al Jazeera.\nOverall, when covering political issues Foreign Policy Journal has a far left bias in story selection and we rate them factually Mixed due to promotion of conspiracy theories.

            "notes": "History\nFounded in 1978 by Anne Nicol Gaylor, the Freedom From Religion Foundation (FFRF) is an American non-profit organization based in Madison, Wisconsin with members from all 50 states. The largest national organization advocating for non-theists, FFRF promotes the separation of church and state and educates the public on matters relating to atheism, agnosticism, and nontheism. \nIn March 2011, FFRF, along with the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science, began The Clergy Project, a confidential on-line community that supports clergy as they leave their faith. In 2012, it gave its first Freedom From Religion Foundation and Clergy Project “Hardship Grant” to Jerry DeWitt, a former pastor who left the ministry to join the atheist movement.\nIn June 2013 FFRF announced that, along with the Secular Student Alliance, it would work on educating students on their religious rights and would assist with rectifying violations and what they have termed “religious infringement into public education”.\nIn 2015, FFRF announced Nonbelief Relief, a new charitable arm. Nonbelief Relief is a humanitarian agency for atheists, agnostics, freethinkers and their supporters “to improve this world, our only world”. Nonbelief Relief seeks to remediate conditions of human suffering and injustice on a global scale, whether the result of natural disasters, human actions or adherence to religious dogma.\nThe FFRF also gives out the the Emperor Has No clothes award which is in recognition of “plain speaking” on the shortcomings of religion by public figures. Some past winners are George Carlin, Richard Dawkins, Ron Reagan, Christopher Hitchens, and Cenk Uygur.\nFunded by / Ownership\nThe FFRF is considered a 501(c)(3) educational organization. Charity Navigator gives FFRF a four out of four star rating or 95%, which means the money they collect goes to the proper causes they support. Funding comes from donations. \nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, ‘the Foundation acts on countless violations of separation of state and church on behalf of members and the public, including: prayers in public schools, payment of public funds for religious purposes, government funding of pervasively sectarian institutions, and the ongoing campaign against civil rights for women, gays and lesbians led by churches.” Headlines and wording of articles on the website utilize moderately loaded words such as this: 46 years post-Roe, right to choice remains under attack. Within the body of this non-sourced article is more loaded language such as this: “The scary truth, however, is that the Religious Right has been steadily engineering rollbacks on Roe v. Wade even before Kavanaugh’s ascension, infiltrating state legislatures and governorships to incrementally strip away women’s access to abortion care.” In another article, Tennessee governor-elect already flouting Constitution, pandering to Religious Right, there is again a complete lack of sourcing information. Although it took several attempts, we did find an article that was sourced to the credible Des Moines Register. Bottom line is FFRF may be publishing factual information, but without sourcing the reader does not know and therefore we have no choice but to rate them Mixed for factual reporting. See Methodology.\nStory selection and policy issues almost always favors the left as this is a secular organization opposed to conservative christian ideology. \nA factual search reveals a half true claim.\nOverall, we rate the FFRF Left biased based on political positions and story selection that consistently favors the left and Mixed for factual reporting due to poor or zero sourcing of information.

The Huffington Post was founded by Andrew Breitbart (Founder of Breitbart), Arianna Huffington (Former Executive Vice President of AOL Time Warner and Chairman of Betaworks and BuzzFeed), Kenneth Lerer (Chairman of Buzzfeed), and Jonah Peretti (CEO of BuzzFeed).\nIn March 2011, AOL acquired The Huffington Post for $315 million and Arianna Huffington was named as president and editor-in-chief of the Huffington Post Media Group, which included AOL properties such as Engadget and MapQuest. In 2015, Verizon bought AOL and the Huffington Post became part of Verizon. In 2016, Arianna Huffington resigned as editor-in-chief and former New York Times Johannesburg Bureau Chief Lydia Polgreen became editor-in-chief. In 2017, The Huffington Post name was shortened to HuffPost.\nFunded by / Ownership\nThe HuffPost is currently owned by Oath Inc., which is a subsidiary of Verizon Communications. The website is funded through online advertising.\nAnalysis / Bias\nPolitico reports, that during the 2016 presidential elections, every article related to Donald Trump included a note at the bottom indicating Trump as being “racist”, “xenophobe”, “Misogynist”, however, after the election, HuffPost dropped the note.\nIn review, HuffPost publishes stories with strong emotionally loaded headlines such as “Comey Flips: ‘Vote for Democrats This Fall’” and “Trump Calls Female Reporter ‘So Obnoxious,’ Tells Her To Be Quiet.” HuffPost utilizes credible sources such as CBS News, New York Times, Politico, as well as blogs that are not known to us such as queensjewelvault.blogspot.com. Furthermore, HuffPost sources the Associated Press when covering world news such as “Mass Graves Suggest Systematic Killing Of Rohingya In Myanmar.” In general, a review of articles shows that more favor the left than the right.\nA factual search reveals that HuffPost had a failed fact check in the past, but promptly removed the article when it was discovered. They also published an Unproven Claim that was not corrected. Given that they corrected a false claim they earn High for factual reporting.\nOverall, we rate HuffPost Left-Biased due to story selection that favors the left and factually High due to proper sourcing of information.

Meduza is similar to Vox, which provides card stacks that provides context and define terms within an article.\nIn review, Meduza uses emotionally loaded language in their headlines such as “Leonid Slutsky must resign from the State Duma“ and in articles they typically source anti-Russian government sources such as RTVI, which is not available in Russia. However, Meduza also utilizes credible sources such as BBC, The Financial Times, AP, Reuters as well as Russian news sources such as Russian News Agency TASS and Russia’s international news agency RIA RU.\nOverall, we rate Meduza high factually due to extensive sourcing, and left biased editorially when it comes to US politics. For example, in this article they favor Obama “It’s become increasingly true and it seems desperately necessary that one man bear responsibility for Russia’s continued economic struggles, its troubles abroad, and nearly anything else rotten occurring under the Sun.

The New Yorker has had many famous contributors including: Dorothy Parker, Robert Benchley, Alexander Woollcott, James Thurber, Sidney J.

There is use of loaded emotional headlines that favor the left, such as this: Bill Nye the Science Guy on Trump’s Climate Change Denial. NowThis News favors more progressive democrats with flattering headlines such as this: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Gives Inspiring Speech at Bernie Sanders Town Hall.

Raw Story also summarizes news from other sources such as this: “Irate customer drags salon owner 50 feet to her death after running out on manicure without paying.” Infrequently, they publish original stories such as this: Trans activist detained in Arizona and threatened with deportation due to bureaucratic catch-22. Raw Story consistently utilizes strong emotionally loaded headlines such as “Trump insists border wall will be ‘all concrete’ — except where it’s ‘see-through’: ‘Makes sense to me!’” and “MSNBC’s Morning Joe mocks ‘confused’ Trump over shutdown boasts: ‘Voters are blaming him’”.\nWhen it comes to sourcing, Raw Story generally sources to credible media outlets such as the Washington Blade, Las Vegas Review-Journal, and the St. Louis Post Dispatch. In general, story selection always favors the left and frequently has an anti-Trump tone. Raw Story has published misleading articles that promote miracle cures such as this one: Scientists discover virus that kills all grades of breast cancer ‘within seven days’. This headline is misleading, as within the article they clearly state “but not in normal mammary epithelial cells.” When it comes to consensus science, they sometimes promote anti-GMO propaganda, however they also publish credible scientifically sound information as well.\nA factual search reveals a Half-True claim from Politifact and an Unproven claim with Snopes.\n\nOverall, we rate Raw Story Left Biased based on story selection that favors the left and Mixed for factual reporting due to half-true and unproven claims, as well as promotion of mild pseudoscience misinformation.

The website appears to be primarily funded through online advertising.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, Second Nexus reports news with a progressive left bias that utilizes moderately loaded emotional language in their headlines and articles such as this: READ: Alan Cross Tweets ‘Falwell’s Clearly Articulated ‘Two Kingdoms’ Theology [I]s the SAME Approach German Lutherans Took as Hitler Rose to Power’ and George W. Bush: Trump ‘Sorta Makes Me Look Pretty Good’. Many articles on Second Nexus source tweets and then provides opinionated commentary about the statements. When sourcing to other information they typically use credible sources such as the World Health Organization and National Journal. Editorially, most opinions come from a left perspective with support for the Environment, LGBT rights, and anti-conservative issues. In general, story selection almost always favors the left.\nA factual search reveals one unproven claim.\nOverall, we rate Second Nexus Left Biased based on story selection that consistently favors the left and High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing of information.

Canary Media Limited is solely owned by its leadership team with no outside shareholders or investors. The Leadership Team comprises of our 3 Directors, 5 Editors and an Advertising Manager. You can view the Companies House records here.  They generate revenue through donations and advertising.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, The Canary publishes political news with the use of strong loaded language in headlines such as this: Media elites say Venezuela proves socialism doesn’t work. But their argument falls flat on its face and this Theresa May’s latest Brexit plan is so ludicrous she might as well promise unicorns sh***ing glitter. While The Canary does not hide their left wing bias they always source their information to credible media outlets such as Forbes, BBC, The Guardian and Huffington Post. In general, story selection favors left leaning progressive issues and frequently denigrates the right.\nA factual search reveals The Canary has not failed a fact check.\nOverall, we rate The Canary Left biased based on story selection that typically favors the left and High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing and a clean fact check record.

The Intercept was founded by former Guardian columnist Glenn Greenwald, documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras, and former Nation writer Jeremy Scahill. \nThe editors are Betsy Reed, Glenn Greenwald and Jeremy Scahill. Glenn Greenwald is a former constitutional law and civil rights litigator who is also known for obtaining and publishing Edward Snowden’s leaks about NSA surveillance while working for The Guardian. \nThe Intercept’s long term mission is “to provide aggressive and independent adversarial journalism across a wide range of issues, from secrecy, criminal and civil justice abuses and civil liberties violations to media conduct, societal inequality and all forms of financial and political corruption.”\nFunded by / Ownership\nThe Intercept is funded by eBay founder Pierre Omidyar’s media company, First Look Media, a non-profit media organization focused on entertainment studio, consumer businesses, and journalism. Omidyar initially committed $250 million and continues to support it through First Look Media.  First Look Media’s other brands include Topic, Field of Vision and the Nib. The Intercept also recieves reader donations.\nAnalysis / Bias\nThe Intercept has been criticized by both Republicans and Democrats such as this New Yorker article that reads “Greenwald’s focus on “deep state” depredations has exiled him from MSNBC but has given him a place on Fox News.” Intercept co-founder Glenn Greenwald has criticized MSNBC host Rachel Maddow for turning into an “utterly scripted, intellectually dishonest, partisan hack.” Greenwald says these criticism have led to an end of his appearances on MSNBC. Greenwald often criticized left leaning media coverage of Trump-Russia collusion, namely CNN, MSNBC and CBS, arguing that “very little evidence supported the idea that Moscow was hot for Donald.” However, The Intercept is harshly critical of both Donald Trump and right wing policies with articles such as this: Trump’s Muslim Ban Is Culmination of War on Terror Mentality but Still Uniquely Shameful.\nIn review, The Intercept publishes articles with strongly emotionally loaded language such as “The Ignored Legacy of George H.W. Bush: War Crimes, Racism, and Obstruction of Justice” and “The 10 Most Appalling Articles in the Weekly Standard’s Short and Dreadful Life.” The Intercept rejects mainstream establishment politics in favor of progressive liberalism with this pro-Bernie Sanders quote: “ignore the opinion polls and the bogus arguments against him: whether you like him or not, Bernie Sanders is the frontrunner right now”, from “Critics Say Bernie Sanders Is Too Old, Too White, and Too Socialist to Run for President in 2020. They’re Wrong.” When it comes to sourcing The Intercept always uses credible sources such as Washington Examiner, The Economist, The Hill Politico, NYMag, and the Washington Post. \nIn general, The Intercept provides indepth investigative stories that are sensational in nature. Most stories are critical of the right-left establishment and lean strongly progressive left in ideology.\nA factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check, however in 2016 they fired Juan Thompson for fabricating quotes and establishing email accounts to trick editors. The Intercept reported: “Thompson admitted to creating fake email accounts and fabricating messages, but stood by his published work. He did not cooperate in the review,”\nOverall, we rate The Intercept progressive Left Biased based on story selection that favors the left and High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing.

The Nation covers world and national news, politics, economy, arts, culture and more. The Nation considers itself as a continuation of William Lloyd Garrison’s anti-slavery newspaper, The Liberator. \nThe Nation’s founding publisher was Joseph H. Richards, and the Irish born American Journalist Edwin Lawrence Godkin, who had formerly worked as a correspondent of the London Daily News and editor of the New York Evening Post.  After the Nation was sold to the New York Evening Post, Godkin became editor of the Post, a position he held until his retirement in 1899. Wendell Phillips Garrison, son of William Lloyd Garrison, was Literary Editor from 1865 to 1906. The Nation was bought by newspaperman-turned-railroad-baron Henry Villard in 1881 and The Nation became a weekly supplement for the New York Evening Post (Later it became the New York Post). After Henry Villard, his son, Oswald Garrison Villard, would became the new owner in 1900.\nThe Nation masthead states that it is edited and published by Katrina vanden Heuvel. Richard Kim is Executive Editor and the President is Erin O’Mara. According to their about page the magazine describes itself as “Principled. Progressive”.\nFunded by / Ownership\nKatrina vanden Heuve is the editor, publisher, and part-owner of The Nation. She also writes an op-ed column for the Washington Post. Subscription and advertising is The Nation’s main revenue as well as donations, which contributes to the Nation Builders campaign.\nAnalysis / Bias\nThe Nation endorsed Bernie Sanders for President in 2016. They also have been criticized for being a Pro-Russia publication by both conservatives and liberals. Here is a quote from the right leaning Washington Free Beacon: “The Nation’s modern day Russia coverage has been criticized as too pro-Putin. Stephen F. Cohen, who is the husband of editor and publisher Katrina vanden Heuvel, has been characterized as a Putin apologist.” However, an op-ed writer for the The Nation, was forcibly removed from a press briefing between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin on July 16, 2018 for holding up a sign regarding a nuclear weapons ban treaty, according to CNBC. \nIn review, The Nation reports news with emotionally loaded words and bias such as “Judge Kavanaugh: An Originalist With a New—and Terrifying—Interpretation of Executive Power” and “It’s Time to Disrupt NATO, But not for the reasons Trump gives.”\nTypically, The Nation utilizes credible sources such as the Associated Press and The Chronicle of Higher Education, however they also source through large quotes as well.\nA factual search reveals The Nation has not failed a fact check and in general produces well written journalism that is factual and well sourced. \nOverall, we rate The Nation Left Biased due to story choices and wording that favor the left and factually high based on proper sourcing.

Melissa Bell is the vice president of growth and analytics, and former Slate Columnist Matthew Yglesias is editor and a columnist for Vox.\nFunded by / Ownership \nVox is owned by Vox Media, which is a digital publishing network founded by Jerome Armstrong, Tyler Bleszinski, and Markos Moulitsas and based in Washington, D.C. According to a Nieman Lab article, Vox Media has eight editorial brands and a custom advertising division. These are (sports-focused) SB Nation, (tech site) The Verge, (video game site) Polygon, (real estate blog) Curbed, (food and nightlife) Eater, (technology news) Racked, (news hub) Vox and (technology business) Recode. Further, a New York Times article dated 2015 states that NBC Universal, which is owned by Comcast, invested $200 Million in Vox Media.\nAnalysis / Bias \nAccording to a Politico interview with the editor, Ezra Klein, Klein describes their goal as “to use technology to improve readers’ experience and understanding of events”. Vox has introduced Vox Card Stacks and with those cards they organize information, in index card format, about all kinds of topics that were in the news with in-depth details but in a summary form. Some examples are: “Everything you need to know about Israel-Palestine” and “The spread of marijuana legalization, explained.”  Vox also has a feature called StoryStream where they provide real-time updates to news stories.\nIn review, Vox looks at the issues from a progressive liberal perspective and there is also an anti-Trump tone in their reporting. Therefore, the majority of stories are pro-left and anti-right. Further, Vox publishes stories with emotionally loaded headlines such as “Are Democrats brave enough to run a woman against Donald Trump?” and “The most depressing energy chart of the year- Coal has got to go” When it comes to sourcing, Vox typically utilizes credible sources such as the NY Times, Associated Press, and Bloomberg. A factual search reveals they have never failed a fact check.\nOverall, we rate Vox Left Biased due to wording and story selection that favors the left and highly factual based on proper sourcing.

Currently co-hosted by Uygur and Ana Kasparian, although its primary focus is on political commentary, the program provides opinion on topics of varying news genres.\nLaunched in 2006, TYT was the first daily streaming online talk show. In 2017, TYT won a Webby Award for best YouTube Presence and on May 17, 2018, The Young Turks launched a 24-hour linear channel on YouTube TV, which includes all of TYT’s current shows and four new shows called The Damage Report, “#NoFilter”,“The Happy Half Hour” and “Old-School Sports”.\nFunded by / Ownership\nThe TYT website does not disclose who owns the Young Turks Network, however it is assumed to be primarily held by Cenk Uygur. In 2017, TYT received 20 million in funding “by newly formed growth equity fund 3L Capital, with additional backing from venture capital veterans Greycroft Partners and e.ventures, as well as Jeffrey Katzenberg’s recently launched WndrCo.” TYT is also supported by the Media Consortium, which is a nonprofit that supports independent journalism. The Media Consortium in turn “got funding from the Chicago Community Trust, the Park Foundation, the Wallace Global Fund, and the Media Democracy Fund. The Media Democracy Fund lists 12 funding partners and one of them is Soros’ the Open Society Foundations.\nThe website and YouTube channel generates revenue through paid subscriptions, advertising and sales of merchandise.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, The Young Turks produces progressive left video news programing as well as written articles on their website. Headlines and articles often contain loaded emotional language such as this: Rep. Rashida Tlaib was sworn in using Thomas Jefferson’s copy of the Quran and, of course, people were mad. and For Tucker Carlson Sponsors, Immigration is Complicated. TYT tends to source their information to credible media outlets such as the Washington Post, USA Today, Sec.gov and Open Secrets. Editorially, The Young Turks tend to support progressive candidates such as Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. In general, all news reporting favors the left and aggressively attacks the right.\nTYT generally supports the consensus of science on most issues, however when it comes to GMO they tend to promote propaganda that points to the dangers of GMO and Glyphosate.\nA factual search reveals that The Young Turks have not failed a fact check.\nOverall, we rate The Young Turks Left Biased based on story selection that always favors the progressive left and Mixed for factual reporting due to promotion of pseudoscience in regards to GMO’s.

The ACLU in their blog section and even news section often cite to places like the Huffington Post for news articles but sometimes they will use basic reporting like AP or Reuters. Beyond their news and blog posts most of the site covers issues that are often considered more liberal causes but most often it is consistent with their stance on the rights they champion. The ACLU has defended the KKK, Pro Abortion, and Neo-Nazi’s right to assemble and protest (1 2 3).  They will often be accused of being left biased as they do not advocate for gun rights, however they equally do not champion gun regulations either.  A quick search for Gun Rights or even Guns will yield no results or results only related to search and seizure cases they have taken on.  They do not agree on the individuals rights to own firearms but do not advocate on their beliefs.  They have teamed up with the NRA several times in a sort of odd fellowship (4). Their Blog & News feed’s can often be filled with more left leaning stances, but they are not biased in their case work load or defending the rights they advocate for. There have been times Justice Scalia the most outspoken and most conservative justice at the time had ideas that line up with the ACLU (5). Most modern conservatives may often take issue with much of what the ACLU advocates and litigates in courts. However, the ACLU has defended religious freedoms in the school as well. Including the right to pray in school (6). I would try to advocate that the ACLU is more neutral than left, but with the major shift in American politics to the right, I can no longer advocate that stance. (M. Allen 2/9/2017)",

While this reflects the individual author’s opinions more than any specific editorial stance this slight lack of focus in overall content is what prevented ATTN from receiving a Least Biased rating. Additionally, ATTN does cite itself occasionally in its other articles, which I find a bit self serving when any news site does it. Even if the content cited is factual. While again, this may reflect the individual author’s rather than editorial intent, it’s easy enough to use external sources instead. That said, the quality of the content on the site is very high, and except for a slight caveat on the bias and self sourcing, I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend ATTN to anyone looking for a solid news source.

            "notes": "History\nFounded in 1922  by John Reith, The British Broadcasting Company is Britain’s public broadcaster. The company later became the British Broadcasting Corporation. The British Broadcasting Company (BBC) began its daily radio transmissions in 1922. The BBC currently provides television, radio, online services throughout Britain and overseas and is headquartered in the Broadcasting House, London, United Kingdom. \nThe BBC began the world’s first regular television service in 1932. During the second world war, TV broadcasting was suspended and BBC radio was an important source for news and entertainment. The BBC held a monopoly on television in Great Britain until 1954 and on radio until 1972. \nFunded by / Ownership\nThe BBC operates under a Royal Charter, which is renewed every 10 years. The Royal Charter abolished the BBC Trust and the regulatory functions of the BBC Trust were transferred to The Office of Communications or Ofcom, in 2017. The operations of the BBC are governed by a board of directors, consisting of thirteen people. Currently, the former Deputy Governor of the Bank of England David Clementi is the Chairman of the BBC and Tony Hall is the Director-General of the BBC (Editor-in-Chief ). The BBC is financed by consumer licence fees on broadcasting receivers (1947 Wireless and Telegraphy Act) which enables BBC’s UK services to be free of advertisements and independent of shareholder and political interests.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, both sides of the political spectrum have accused BBC of either having a liberal bias or conservative bias. For example, an Evening Standard article based on an interview with a former BBC employee, describes the BBC as a “Nest of Lefties promoting a progressive agenda and political correctness.” According to a Times of London article the BBC is biased against Israel, therefore it has a left bias. The BBC states in their editorial guidelines that they are impartial and free from both political and commercial influence. The BBC also has an Executive Complaints Unit in which the Daily Mail published an article regarding how the complaints unit works. The article states “There was also a sharp increase in accusations of political bias and religious prejudice.” The BBC then wrote a response to the Daily Mail article: “The Mail also said that the figures ‘showed the level of dissatisfaction over issues such as left-wing bias, offensive content and inaccuracy’. In fact there is a very wide range of reasons why people complain. For example we often get complaints of ‘bias’ about the same programme from two or more opposing sides of the many issues we cover, not just ‘left wing’”.\n\nAccording to New Statesman research, which was examining the impartiality of BBC’s reporting shows that in certain areas they lean right, such as business, immigration, and religion. Examples of right bias, includes the BBC being accused of doctoring the image of Jeremy Corbyn, who serves as Leader of the Labour Party (Corbyn identifies as a democratic socialist) wearing a Russian style cap in front of a Moscow skyline to make him look more Russian. BBC rejected the complaints by claiming the decision to publish Corbyn in a “Lenin-style cap in front of the Moscow skyline was not designed to convey an impression of pro-Russian sympathy on Corbyn’s part, but was in keeping with an editorial decision made on the basis of sound news judgment”.\nWhen reporting general news the BBC always sources its information and uses minimal loaded words in headlines such as this: Trump chief of staff John Kelly to leave White House job. When it comes to reporting on the USA and in particular President Donald Trump, there is a negative tone directed at Trump and his policies. In general, the BBC covers both sides of stories, with a slight bias in favor of the left.\nA factual search reveals that the BBC has never failed a fact check.\nOverall, we rate the BBC Left-Center biased based on story selection that slightly favors the left and High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing of information.

Moyers has won countless journalism awards throughout his career and the content on his website is no exception to those standards. All articles are well sourced and factual. The content does have a left-center lean based on story selection and wording. (D. Van Zandt 2/25/2017)",

Bloomberg is a business-focused news organization headquartered in New York City. Bloomberg News is a division of Bloomberg L.P., which also includes a global television network (Bloomberg Television), digital websites, radio stations (Bloomberg Radio), subscription-only newsletters, and three magazines: Bloomberg Magazine, Bloomberg Businessweek and Bloomberg Markets. \nBloomberg delivers business and markets news, data and analysis to its readers. Further, they also have a section under politics called “Trump Tracker” which tracks the latest news and reports on Donald Trump. Former editor of The Economist, John Micklethwait is the editor-in-chief of Bloomberg News since 2015. Michael R. Bloomberg is the President & CEO. \nFunded by / Ownership\nMichael R. Bloomberg is the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP (The parent company of Bloomberg News). According to Investopedia, Bloomberg Terminal (remote software used to access financial information) is the most expensive among financial data providers. Bloomberg News started to charge visitors for its content with a metered paywall in 2018, limiting users to view 10 articles per month, and 30 minutes of Bloomberg TV livestream daily. After 10 articles, readers have to become a digital subscriber to have full access.\nAnalysis / Bias\nMichael R. Bloomberg Philanthropies’ five areas of focus are public health, arts and culture, the environment, education, and government innovation. As a philanthropist, Bloomberg has given over $3.3 billion in support of education, public health, government innovation, the arts, and the environment. Michael R. Bloomberg is the president of the C40 Climate Leadership Group. Further, Michael R. Bloomberg endorsed Hillary Clinton for the 2016 presidential election. \nIn review, Bloomberg publishes stories with moderately loaded emotional headlines such as this editorial:“America’s Values Must Guide White House Diplomacy That’s why the Trump-Putin summit is so risky”, “Kavanaugh and Partisanship on the Supreme Court” and Trump Gives Putin a Win in Finland, Kindling New Outrage at Home.” When it comes to sourcing, Bloomberg typically utilize themselves, but they also use credible sources such as CBS News, oyez.org, and the New York Times. They also re-publish articles from the Associated Press.\nA factual search reveals that Bloomberg has published one half-true claim. This does not constitute a failed a fact check by our criteria.\nOverall, we rate Bloomberg Left-Center biased due to story selection that slightly favors the left and factually high due to proper sourcing.

In 2016, BuzzFeed split the News operation off from the BuzzFeed Entertainment Group, which aims to focus more on BuzzFeed’s video unit. The Buzzfeed brands are Tasty, Nifty, Goodful and more. \nFunded by / Ownership\nBuzzFeed is funded by numerous investors. NEA (New Enterprise Associates), New York-based venture capital firm RRE and Hearst Ventures were the early investors of Buzzfeed.  \nIn 2015, NBC (Comcast) invested $200 million in BuzzFeed and in 2016 they invested another $200 million. BuzzFeed also raised $50 million dollars from venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. BuzzFeed is privately owned and does not disclose financial results to the public.

When it comes to sourcing they typically source to themselves, however they also utilize credible sources such as the Des Moines Register and Associated Press. Further, BuzzFeed does not clearly label opinion pieces, which makes it difficulty to tell the difference between straight news content and editorials. In general, most Buzzfeed stories favor the left.\nIn January 2017, Buzzfeed published the Steele Dossier about alleged Russia collusion, which caused President Donald Trump to criticize them by saying Buzzfeed is a ‘failing pile of garbage’.

CBC presents news, talk, music and entertainment programs in English, French and Aboriginal languages. The CBC is based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.\nIn 2009, CBC’s Television News, Radio News and Digital News departments were merged into CBC News. Michael Goldbloom is the chairman and Catherine Tait is the President and Chief Executive Officer of Canadian Broadcasting Corp.\nFunded by / Ownership\nThe CBC Board previously consisted of 12 members, all appointed by the Prime Minister of Canada. For example, former conservative prime minister Stephen Harper was accused of appointing the board with members that were also conservative donors. In 2016, Brian Mitchell (who was appointed to the CBC board by then prime minister Stephen Harper in 2008) resigned to seek the presidency of the Conservative Party of Canada. However, recently this structure has changed, and now the non-partisan Independent Advisory Committee does “merit-based” appointments. According to a Globe and Mail article “A government source said the board would comprise nine ‘experts in broadcasting and digital technology, representatives of cultural sectors from across Canada,’ as well as ‘Indigenous peoples, official-language communities and youth,’ who will be charged with compiling a list of candidates whose names will be submitted to the government.”\nThe CBC’s main revenue comes from government funding (66%), other sources of revenue include advertising revenue (18%), subscriber fees (8%) and other sources. You can also view CBC Business Model details Here.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, when it comes to world news CBC re-publishes stories from credible sources such as the Associated Press and Reuters: “U.S. stock markets flirt with end of historic rise” and “Indonesian rescuers struggle against heavy rain to reach tsunami-hit villages.”\nCBS reports Canadian national news with neutral headlines such as: “The 5 most dramatic moments of the year in Ontario politics”. When it comes to sourcing, the CBC typically sources to other CBC articles. This is acceptable as CBC produces and reports its own national news. \nIn general, CBC’s straight news reporting is consistently low biased, factual and covers both sides of issues. Editorially, the opinion pages tend to be balanced with some stories slightly leaning left such as this: Doug Ford’s ‘efficiencies’ seem to be costing taxpayers an awful lot of money: Robyn Urback and right leaning: Why low-income earners should actually welcome Ontario’s reversal on rent control. Opinion pieces have also been critical of liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. On a whole, slightly more opinion pieces favor the left. Further, the right leaning National Post has accused the CBC of liberal bias.\nA factual search reveals that the CBC has not failed a fact check.\nOverall, we rate CBC Left-Center Biased based on editorial positions that leans slightly left and High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing and a clean fact check record.

The LA Times was acquired by then Editor/publisher Harrison Gray Otis. In 1885, Harry Chandler, who had been hired initially as a circulation department clerk, become Harrison Otis’ son in law. Under Chandler and Otis the paper was anti-union, which led to the 1910 bombing of the LA Times building, resulting in the deaths of 21 employees. In 1944, Norman Chandler succeeded his father Harry Chandler and in the 1960’s, Norman’s son Otis Chandler became the owner and publisher of the LA Times. Otis Chandler “transformed the Los Angeles Times from a conservative paper into a Pulitzer Prize-winner.” It was under Otis Chandler that the paper won its first of 44 Pulitzer Prizes. \nIn June 2000, Tribune Co., owner of the Chicago Tribune, acquired Times Mirror Co., parent company of the LA Times, which ended “100 years of local ownership of The Times by the Otis and Chandler families.” \nIn 2018, Biotech billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong acquired LA Times for $500m from the Tribune Publishing Company (formerly Tronc) and became the owner and executive chairman of the Los Angeles Times. Former Vice Chairman of Time inc., Norman Pearlstine is the Executive Editor. See the Masthead for a complete list of the editorial team. \nThe LA Times covers local/national news, business, entertainment, political analysis and sports news. The LA Times is headquartered in Los Angeles, California. \nFunded by / Ownership\nBiotech billionaire Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong is the owner of LA Times. The paper is funded through advertising, subscriptions and newsstand sales.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, the LA Times (Los Angeles Times) uses moderately emotionally loaded headlines such as this “Outgoing White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly defends his rocky tenure” and “Engaging with the world doesn’t make Americans ‘suckers’”  The wording within articles also tends to lean left as evidenced by this quote from an editorial “Congress needs to focus not only on how amateurishly Trump executes foreign policy but the clear shortcomings of the policy itself.” When it comes to sourcing the LA Times rarely uses hyperlinked sourcing, which is acceptable as news stories are covered and written by their journalists. When using hyperlinked sources they utilize credible ones such as the Financial Times.\nEditorially, the LA Times has endorsed Democratic Presidential Candidates in the last three elections and during 2016 General Election the LA Times stated that “Hillary Clinton would make a sober, smart and pragmatic president. Donald Trump would be a catastrophe.”  \nIn a 2018 Interview, Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong told NPR “We’ll be as competitive vis-à-vis the The New York Times and The Washington Post.”\nA factual search reveals that the LA Times has never failed a fact check.\n\nOverall, we rate the LA Times, Left-Center Biased based on editorial positions that favor the left and High for factual reporting due to a clean fact check record.

            "notes": "History\nLaunched in 1976 and based in San Francisco, California, Mother Jones or MoJo is a news organization that is named after labor activist Mary Harris “Mother” Jones. Mother Jones focuses on investigative journalism on topics including politics, governments, corporations, environment, crime & justice. They distribute their content via digital and social platforms, videos, podcasts, email newsletters and print magazine. They describe their mission as “to deliver hard-hitting reporting that inspires change and combats “alternative facts.” In 1993, they became the first general interest magazine to go online.\nCurrently, Steve Katz is the publisher. Mother Jones is published by The Foundation for National Progress. Monika Bauerlein is CEO and Clara Jeffery is the Editor-in-Chief. David Corn is the Washington bureau chief and an on-air analyst for MSNBC.\nFor the complete list of staff, click here.  \nFunded by / Ownership\nMother Jones’ Non Profit Parent company and publisher is the Foundation for National Progress (FNP) and according to the MacArthur Foundation, the Foundation for National Progress received $1.5 million grants in support for its in-depth investigative journalism work. The Board of Directors can be seen here and the complete donor list here. \nMother Jones’ primary source of revenue is reader donations, subscriptions, advertising and foundation grants, for example the Craigslist founder gave $1 million to Mother Jones in 2018.  You can find details of their finances and IRS Form 990s Here. \nAnalysis / Bias\nAlthough Mother Jones political inclinations have been described as progressive, they did not endorse any political party during the 2016 presidential election. They have published articles with an anti-Bernie Sanders tone such as from this article “Poor Bernie Sanders has fallen victim to the hack gap.” This stance has been criticized by other left leaning publications as “Mother Jones’ Legacy Is Haunting Mother Jones as the Magazine Embraces Neoliberalism”. However, they have also been critical of Hillary Clinton with this article: Let’s Cut the Crap About Why Hillary Clinton Lost.\nMother Jones frequently publishes detailed investigative journalism such as “The full data set from our in-depth investigation into mass shootings.” This investigation has been criticized by some on the right, such as Reason.com.\nIn review, some articles we analysed offers support for Republicans such as “This Deep-Red State Decided to Make a Serious Investment in Preschools. It’s Paying Off Big-Time”, by praising Lawmakers such as Jeana Ross, Republican Secretary for the Alabama Department of Early Childhood Education, and Alabama state Senator Trip Pittman for their accomplishments in the states preschool program. On the other hand, they also have other articles we reviewed that has emotionally loaded headlines that are negative toward Republicans such as “Patriots Games, Birthday Bashes, and Vicious Tweets: Trump and Romney’s Failed Bromance.” \nIn general, story selection moderately favors the left, although the progressive left tends to be criticized more often than the establishment left. When it comes to sourcing, Mother Jones sources to credible media outlets such as Reuters, NY Times, The Hill, CNN, Time Magazine, NPR, Politico, Washington Examiner, and C-Span.\nA factual search reveals that Mother Jones has not failed a fact check.\nOverall, we rate Mother Jones strongly Left-Center biased based on story selection that moderately favors the left and High for factual reporting due to thorough sourcing.

MSN aggregates news from a wide variety of mainstream sources. The MSN News homepage breaks news into categories such as World, US, Business, Politics, Local, etc. \nFunded by / Ownership\nMSN News is owned by Microsoft.\nAnalysis / Bias\nDetermining the a bias of a news aggregator is different than from a single source that produces original content. The wording on MSN News comes from other sources, so we will not even look at that as a factor. The most logical way to determine the bias of a news aggregator is too look at the sources they use for their news content. To accomplish this we looked at what sources were being used in the categories US News and World News. Over the course of three days we looked at the top 25 sources in each category for a total of 150 sources calculated. We then compared these sources to our bias ratings and calculated what percentage come from each bias category. Overall, the majority of stories on MSN News come from Left-Center sources (51%) and 31% from Least Biased sources. Further, Right-Center sources only made up 1% of the news and Right biased 5%, while on the other hand 12% of stories come from the Left Biased category. When looking at purely left-leaning vs right-leaning sources, the numbers favor the left. See charts below:\n\n\nIt should be noted that we are not stating MSN is willfully biased, we are pointing out that the sources used have a preference for the left according to our ratings. This could be due to how the algorithm works and also that there simply are more mainstream news media that leans left.\nOverall, we rate MSN News strongly Left-Center biased with the majority of stories coming from Left-Center sources. We also rate them High for factual reporting because the majority of sources used are credible media outlets. (6/2/2017) Updated (D. Van Zandt 11/29/2018)",

            "notes": "History\nFounded in 1970, NPR (National Public Radio) is a nonprofit organization that produces and distributes news, talk, cultural programming, music and entertainment programs, including the premier news magazines Morning Edition and All Things Considered across broadcast and digital platforms. NPR is based in Washington, D.C. \nNPR was established after President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967. The act created the Corporation for Public Broadcasting(CPB), the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), and National Public Radio (NPR).\nThe first program broadcast on NPR was live coverage of the U.S. Senate deliberations on the Vietnam War in April 1971. NPR has also won numerous awards since its launch. Currently, Jarl Mohn is the CEO of NPR and the Ombudsman/Public Editor is Elizabeth Jensen. A list of NPR’s Board of Directors can be found Here. \nFunded by / Ownership\nAccording to a Columbia Journalism Review article dated 2010, a large portion of NPR’s revenue comes from dues and fees paid by Member stations and by corporate sponsorships. In another article by Columbia Journalism Review they state that as of 2017, NPR receives less than 1 percent of its total funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting(CPB). Other sources of revenue include institutional grants, individual contributions and fees paid by users of the Public Radio Satellite System. You can view all of NPR’s Financial Statements Here.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn 2000, the conservative pro-Israel media watchdog group CAMERA, accused NPR of being biased against Israel. In 2001, FAIR (Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting), a progressive media watchdog group criticized NPR for favoring Israel. FAIR also states “NPR is definitely skewing right.” Tim Groseclose, a professor in the Economics and Political Science Department at UCLA, and Jeff Milyo, an economics professor at the University of Missouri, reports NPR has liberal bias. Further, according to a Pew Research survey, 67% of NPR listeners identify as left of center, with 41% claiming to be consistently liberal. Finally, According to the Washington Post, NPR CEO Jarl Mohn has contributed to Democratic candidates in statewide races, including the campaign of Robert Reich, President Bill Clinton’s secretary of labor. \nIn review, NPR (National Public Radio) uses moderately emotional loaded headlines such as this: “President Trump’s Description of What’s ‘Fake’ Is Expanding.” Generally, story selection favors the Left with stories such as these: “Rise Of LGBTQ Candidates Could Usher In A ‘Rainbow Wave’ In 2018” and Majority Of Americans Don’t Want Roe v. Wade Overturned. They also report right leaning opinion pieces such as this: A Free-Market Economy Keeps Capitalism Ticking.\nNPR reports world news with neutral headlines such as “In Bangladeshi Camps, Rohingya Refugees Try To Move Forward With Their Lives. NPR typically sources their information to credible sources such as the Washington Post, maristpoll.marist.edu, ohchr.org, The Economist, UNICEF, New York Times and many more. NPR’s news reporting is consistently low biased, factual and covers both sides of issues. However, taken on a whole, NPR is favored by a liberal audience, which indicates programming and story selection tends to lean left to appeal to their core listeners.\nA factual search reveals that NPR has not failed a fact check.\nOverall, we rate NPR (National Public Radio) Left-Center Biased based on story selection that leans slightly left and Very High for factual reporting due to thorough sourcing and very accurate news reporting.

Quartz publishes stories with neutral headlines such as “To understand Trump’s speech, look at the US-Mexico border as it exists today”, as well as strong emotionally loaded language such as “A living glossary of all the words you need to understand the Trump presidency.”  A quote from the article reads “Trump is seen as the editor-in-chief of the fake news movement because of his disregard of facts, such as when he claimed in a recent tweet, with no supporting evidence, that millions voted illegally in the US election.” When it comes to sourcing, they typically utilize credible sources such as c-span.org, New York Times, Huffington Post, and USA Today.\nEditorially, Quartz does not endorse any political party, however their sister publication, The Atlantic endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Presidential elections. Further, Quartz does not have a favorable view of President Trump with consistent negative articles pertaining to his administration: Another scandal-ridden member of Trump’s cabinet is resigning. Lastly, Quartz is generally pro-science with its reporting on GMO’s and Climate Change.\nA factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.\nOverall, we rate Quartz Left-Center Biased based on story selection that slightly favors left and High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing of information and a clean fact check record.

For example, in an article titled “Russia Vows ‘Adequate Response’ After US Expels 35 Russian Diplomats For ‘Spying’,” Scoopwhoop claims in a quote, that according to the BBC, Russia will “cause the US government ‘significant destruction’“. This simply is not true as Putin never said this and the BBC never reported it.  Overall, this source tends to have a left-center reporting bias and is not always well sourced and factual (M.

You can view  the Guardian U.S editorial team here.\nFunded by / Ownership\nThe Guardian and its sister publication, Sunday newspaper The Observer, are both owned by Guardian Media Group plc (GMG). Scott Trust Limited was created in 1936, to ensure the editorial independence of the publications and owns Guardian Media Group plc (GMG). The Guardian states that “The Scott Trust is the sole shareholder in Guardian Media Group and its profits are reinvested in journalism and do not benefit a proprietor or shareholders.” The Guardian is funded through donations and an advertising model.\nThe Guardian switched to a tabloid print format in 2018 in order to cut costs. According to The New York Times, The Guardian “refused to set up a paywall — the preferred strategy of many of its rivals, from The Times of London to The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times — opting instead to ask its readers for donations, even setting up a nonprofit arm to help fund its journalism.” \nAnalysis / Bias\nThroughout its history, The Guardian has always been a left-wing publication as they have stated in various articles.\n\nIn review, story selection favors the left, but is generally factual. They utilize emotionally loaded headlines such as “The cashless society is a con – and big finance is behind it” and “Trump back-pedals on Russian meddling remarks after outcry”.  The Guardian typically utilizes credible sources such as thoughtco.com, gov.UK, HuffPost, independent.co.uk, and the Miami Herald.\nA factual search reveals that the Guardian has a clean fact check record.\nOverall, we rate The Guardian Left-Center biased based on story selection that moderately favors the left and High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing and a clean fact check record.

The Independent was launched by former Telegraph staffers Andreas Whittam Smith, Matthew Symonds, and Stephen Glover.  It is headquartered in London. In 1990, The Independent on Sunday was launched and edited by Stephen Glover. In 1994, the founders left the paper and Ian Hargreaves became the editor of the paper. A year later Newspaper Publishing was restructured, with Mirror Group and Tony O’Reilly’s Independent News & Media (INM) becoming joint owners of Newspaper Publishing. In 1998, INM took full control of the The Independent. O’Reilly bought out the company for £30m and in 2010 and then Russian billionaire Alexander Lebedev and his son Evgeny Lebedev acquired The Independent. In 2016, the paper moved to a digital-only format. Simon Kelner is currently the editor-in-chief of the Independent titles. Andreas Whittam Smith, the founder of The Independent, has also joined the board of Independent Print Limited. In 2017, Saudi Businessman Sultan Muhammad Abuljadayel bought a 30% stake in the Independent online newspaper. \n\nFunded by / Ownership\nThe Independent is owned by Independent Print Limited, a company owned by the Lebedev family (Alexander Lebedev and his son Evgeny Lebedev). In 2017, Saudi Businessman Sultan Muhammad Abuljadayel bought a 30% stake in the Independent online newspaper. The paper is funded through advertising and subscriptions. \n\nAnalysis / Bias\nThe Independent recently joined up with a media group that has close links to the Saudi royal family to launch websites across the Middle East. Its partnering with a publisher that has strong links to the Saudi government has been criticized by the Guardian.\nIn review, The Independent tends to publish stories utilizing minimally loaded language in their headlines such as: “Theresa May insists Brexit deal is not dead despite EU leaders refusing to make further concessions”  and US news “Mueller investigation: Special counsel attacks Flynn criticism of FBI interview”. The Independent also republishes news from other credible sources such as the Associated Press: “Five things you didn’t know about Germany’s diesel ban”. In general, most stories favor the left and tend to be sourced properly utilizing credible sources such as USA Today and the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel.\nAccording to a 2017 survey conducted by You Gov UK, The Independent is viewed as having a center-left bias in reporting with 79% saying it was either Center or Left and only 21% saying it leaned right.\nA factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.\nOverall we rate the The Independent Left-Center Biased due to story selection that moderately favors the left and High for factual reporting based on proper sourcing of information and a clean fact check record.

After only 6 weeks the Meredith Corporation sold Time Magazine to Marc Benioff and his wife Lynne for $190 million. Benioff is the billionaire founder of Salesforce.com and is an activist as it relates to left leaning causes such as equal pay for equal work, affordable health care and support for a livable wage.\nFunded by / Ownership\nTime Magazine is owned Marc and Lynne Benioff and is funded through subscriptions, sponsored content and advertising sales.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, Time a is a journalism magazine the covers current events and politics. Time utilizes loaded language in headlines such as this: President Trump Is Making Baseless Claims About the Migrant Caravan. Here Are the Facts. The information contained in articles is generally well sourced and linked to credible factual sources. Story selection mostly favors with left with articles such as this: Obama Rails Against Republicans in Fiery Nevada Rally. While Time Magazine is clearly biased in favor of left leaning causes, they display a strong anti-Trump bias with daily articles denigrating his policies and actions. It is important to note that holding an anti-Trump bias is not necessarily a pro-left wing bias as many centrist and right-center sources also report against President Trump’s character and policies.\nA factual search reveals that Time Magazine has never failed a fact check.\nOverall, we rate Time Magazine Left-Center biased based on story selection that mostly favors the left and High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing and a clean fact check record.

In reporting local news there is minimal use of loaded language: Province submits fresh evidence in ongoing court fight over Toronto council cut. Editorials on the other hand, utilize moderately loaded headlines that favor the left such as this: It’s time for Doug Ford to stop campaigning and start governing. Further, the Toronto Star has always endorsed progressive democratic candidates for most of its history, most recently endorsing Justin Trudeau.

In this interview with Suroosh Alvi, he provides details how Vice was born. In 1998, the partners sold part of Vice to Montreal software magnate Richard Szalwinski, however soon they bought the magazine back. Once called “Voice of Montreal” they eventually changed the name to Vice. In 1999, Vice relocated its base to New York City and became Vice Media, which grew into a digital media company that publishes online and in print magazines and expanded into millennial-driven media consisting of a website, broadcast news unit, a film production company, a record label, and a publishing imprint and more.  Its news division, Vice News launched in 2013 and focused around news and current events. Currently, Nancy Dubuc is the CEO and Shane Smith is the Executive Chairman. According to its about page, Suroosh Alvi & Shane Smith are listed as owners, whereas Gavin McInnes is not listed since he left due to “creative differences”.  Gavin McInnes, later founded the Proud Boys which is defined as hate group. \nFunded by / Ownership\nAccording to Forbes, Shane Smith owns approximately (20%) and the rest of the shares belongs to The Walt Disney Company, A&E Networks, TPG Capital (the private equity group), and 21st Century Fox. Vice Media missed revenue targets by $100m and according to a Forbes article“ Disney wrote down $157m of its investment in Vice” which indicates a sign of trouble “for the youth-focused media company.” Further, CNBC reports Vice is reportedly reducing staff by 15%. Vice News is funded primarily through advertising.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn 2017, investigative reporting by Emily Steel of the New York Times, uncovered mistreatment and sexual harassment of women and workplace culture at Vice Media, which was described by ex-employees as toxic. Following the report, Vice Media President Andrew Creighton resigned, which then CEO and now Executive Chairman Shane Smith has acknowledged and apologized, promising change. The company later announced that they established a Diversity and Inclusion Board.\nIn review, Vice News offers a progressive liberal perspective in reporting such as “Millennials Don’t Love Capitalism but Can’t Stop Using Amazon”.  Vice News has an anti-Trump tone in their articles such as This Is What It Takes for a Trump Voter to Change Their Mind and “Trump Foundation is shutting down after the New York AG called it “little more than a checkbook” for Trump.” However, Vice News utilizes credible sources such as the Washington Post, ocf.berkeley.edu, Vox , AP, ag.ny.gov, Forbes, Washington Examiner, Business Insider , census.gov, and the NY Times. In general, more stories favor the left and present a more favorable left leaning perspective on issues.\nA factual search reveals that Vice News has not failed a fact check.\nOverall, we rate Vice Media Left-Center Biased due to wording and story selection that moderately favors the left and High for factual reporting based on proper sourcing.

Katharine Weymouth, a granddaughter of Katharine Meyer Graham and niece of Donald Graham served as the publisher of The Washington Post until her resignation in 2014. Currently, Frederick J. Ryan Jr., the founder of Politico and a former Reagan administration official is the Publisher and CEO of The Post. Martin Baron is the executive editor.\nFunded by / Ownership\nIn 2013, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos bought The Washington Post for $250 million. Bezos is a frequent target of Trump, who has accused the businessman of using the Postal System as its “Delivery Boy.” The newspaper’s executive editor, Martin Baron said Jeff Bezos, who founded Amazon, is not involved in its news coverage. According to a NY Magazine article “Bezos is libertarian who has given money to anti-tax initiatives in the past” and supports gay marriage through donations. Bezos also donated to both Democratic and Republican Senators respectively.\nAnalysis / Bias\nThe Washington Post played a part with The New York Times in publishing excerpts of the Pentagon Papers in 1971. The original papers can be viewed Here. The Washington Post started reporting on Watergate in 1972, linking the DNC break-in to Nixon’s campaign and eventually brought down the administration of President Richard Nixon. \nAccording to Pew Research, the Washington Post is more trusted by a liberal readers than conservatives. However, in 2016, The Washington Post published an anti-Bernie Sanders editorial “Bernie Sanders’s fiction-filled campaign” that the New Republic called an “embarrassment.”\nThe Washington Post was involved in a scandal in 1980, when they published an article by Janet Cooke that won the Pulitzer Prize. Cooke later returned the Pulitzer Prize when it turned out the story was not true.\nIn review, The Washington Post publishes stories with emotionally loaded headlines such as “Trump escalates China trade war, announces plan for tariffs on $200 billion in products” and in editorials “The Trump administration created this awful border policy. It doesn’t need Congress to fix it.” When it comes to sourcing they typically utilize credible sources such as Propublica.org, Associated Press, Slate, Princeton.edu, New York Times, wired.com and CNN. Story selection and editorials tend to favor the left with the Washington Post only endorsing Democratic candidates since 1976, including Hillary Clinton in the last election. \nOverall, we rate The Washington Post Left-Center biased due to story selection that favors the left and factually High due to the use of proper sources.

Wired covers the tech industry such as internet and digital culture, science and security. In 1998, Louis Rossetto and Jane Metcalfe sold Wired Magazine to Conde Nast, a unit of Advance Publications Inc. for about $80 million. Former editor of the New Yorker, Nicholas Thompson was named editor in chief of Wired in 2017. Thompson is also a contributor for CBS News and regularly appears on CBS This Morning and CBSN. He is a co-founder of The Atavist.\n\nFunded by / Ownership\nAdvance Publication subsidiary Condé Nast Inc. is the current owner of Wired Magazine. Wired’s business model is primarily built on advertising. However, since January 2018, Wired, like other Condé Nast publications, is subscription based, which allows subscribers unlimited access without display advertising.  All readers have access to the homepage, section front pages, and four articles per month at no charge before being asked to subscribe. \nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, Wired publishes magazine stories, news analysis, and web stories with a focus on technology. In doing so, they utilize emotive language both in their headlines and body of articles such as “Here’s how facebook actually won Trump the presidency.” Wired also reports on political issues that are related to the tech industry. For example, editor in chief Nicholas Thompson mentions in an interview, Wired’s position on Net Neutrality and why they report on it. We examined one of those articles “Kavanaugh On The Supreme Court Could Spell Trouble For Tech”, which favors a left leaning viewpoint on the subject. \nWhen it comes to sourcing, Wired typically utilizes credible sources such as cadc.uscourts.gov, Associated Press, Military.com, New York Times, Bloomberg, and US News and World Report. Wired also publishes pro-science articles such as “The Complexity of Simply Searching For Medical Advice” and utilizes pro-science sources such as PubMed and the CDC. \nA factual search reveals that Wired has never failed a fact check by an IFCN fact checker.\nOverall, we rate Wired Left-Center biased in wording and report choices and factually high due to proper sourcing.

Furthermore, Xinhua cannot seem to glorify Xi Jinping enough.\nA factual search reveals the Xinhua has not failed a fact check by and IFCN fact checker.\nOverall, we rate Xinhua Left-Center biased based on left leaning editorials that endorse socialism/communism.

In reviewing the blog portion of this website I found well sourced information that stuck to the topic of Russia’s misinformation campaigns in elections. All information was well sourced to mostly mainstream credible news sources that ranged from Left-Center to Right-Center in bias. The Alliance for Securing Democracy has also developed a tool called Hamilton 68 that tracks Russian propaganda on Twitter. We cannot verify the accuracy of this tool, but the information is interesting and delivered without comment. The Alliance for Securing Democracy has also been criticized by The Intercept for presenting a right leaning hawkish view point.

The website is funded through advertising.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, American Military News’ reporting on national security and US military utilizes minimally loaded language in their headlines and articles such as AZ man gets 12 years for helping college student join ISIS or Trump to withdraw half of 14,000 US troops in Afghanistan, reports say. Both of these stories are properly sourced to credible media outlets. Besides original content, American Military News also curates and republishes military related news from other credible sources such as: Stars and Stripes (Least Biased), Hindustan Times (Left-Center), San Diego Union-Tribune (Least Biased), Roll Call (Least Biased), and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (Least Biased).\nAmerican Military News also has an opinion page that is reasonably balanced and does not offer extreme opinions. A general overview shows many editorials pertaining to gun ownership rights and pro-military positions, which makes sense given the genre of this website.\nA factual search reveals that American Military News has not failed any fact checks by IFCN fact checkers. Further, American Military News offers a comprehensive fact-checking policy that you can read here.\nOverall, we rate American Military News Least Biased based on story selection that is balanced and free of loaded words, however there is a slight rightward lean editorally, but still offers balance. We also rate them High for factual reporting due to a clean fact check record and use of low biased sources. (10/10/2017) Updated (D. Van Zandt 12/22/2018)",

Along with this commitment to opposing repression of freedom of expression, Amnesty International’s founding principles included non-intervention on political questions, a robust commitment to gathering facts about the various cases and promoting human rights. Governments and their supporters have criticized Amnesty’s criticism of their policies, including those of Australia, Czech Republic,  China, Democratic Republic of the Congo, India, Iran, Israel, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, Russia and the United States,for what they assert is one-sided reporting or a failure to treat threats to security as a mitigating factor.

It is a multinational not-for-profit news agency headquartered in New York City and currently owned by its contributing newspapers, radio, and television stations in the United States. The Associated Press (AP) states its mission as “to inform the world” and describes its brief history as “In 1846, five New York City newspapers funded a pony express route through Alabama to bring news of the Mexican War north faster than the U.S. Post Office could deliver it. And The Associated Press was born.” \nThe evolution of relations between the world news agencies (Reuters, AFP, Associated Press) can be read here. Steven R. Swartz is Chairman of the AP, as well as President & CEO of Hearst and Gary B. Pruitt is the President and CEO of the Associated Press. Here is the complete list of AP Board of Directors and management committee.\nFunded by / Ownership\nThe Associated Press (AP) is a non profit news cooperative which had a profit of $1.6 million in 2016.  The AP is owned by its contributing newspapers, radio and television stations in the United States, all of which contribute stories to the AP and use material written by its staff journalists. It also sells content to other media organizations. According to an article titled “AP reports loss on one-time accounting charges” the Associated Press lost $74 million in 2017 and it states the reason as “mostly due to one-time accounting charges related to the federal tax overhaul passed late last year.” AP’s Chief Financial Officer is Ken Dale. \nAnalysis / Bias\nIn their political coverage, AP utilizes moderate loaded language in their headlines such as “AP Exclusive: Before Trump job, Manafort worked to aid Putin.” However, the articles are always well sourced. When it comes to their economic coverage they maintain neutral language and least biased coverage: “US-China tariffs: What’s behind them, who stands to be hurt?” The AP also publishes well researched and sourced articles such as “Science Says: How family separation may affect kids’ brains”, utilizing pro-science sources such as American Academy of Pediatrics.\nA factual search reveals a clean track record for the Associated Press.\nOverall, we rate the Associated Press Least Biased based on balanced story selection and High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing and a clean fact check record.

In their own words they “propagate news content resourced for each major region, country, city, and U.S. state, in addition to each major industry sector, business and sports.”\nBig News Network provides breaking news on topics such as Health, Internet, Technology, Sport, and Business & Finance. In November 2013 the company became a shareholder in Ireland’s iRadio FM radio network.\nFunded by / Ownership\nThe Owner and operator of Big News Network is Big News Network FZ LLC, a company incorporated in the United Arab Emirates. Administering the News.Net network on behalf of Big News Network is Mainstream Media Limited, a company based in the UK, while the Big News Network’s eNewspapers are distributed by the Midwest Radio Network, a company incorporated in Sydney, Australia in 1938.\n\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, Big News Network utilizes minimally loaded language both in their headlines and articles such as “Giuliani admits he is aiming to delegitimize Mueller’s probe.” In news articles they use large blocks of quotes such as “U.S. Deputy Attorney-General Rod Rosenstein said that action would be taken if any infiltration was found and added, “If anyone did infiltrate or surveil participants in a presidential campaign for inappropriate purposes, we need to know about it and take appropriate action.” However, they fail to provide links to the original source of the quote. Big News Network is low biased and balanced in news reporting, but they simply fail to source their information properly.\nOverall, we rate Big News Network Least Biased based on story selection and Mixed for factual reporting due to poor sourcing methods.

Most of the website consists of charts and graphs that highlight slavery by country, which quite frankly is eye opening. Despite the criticism of methodology, this source is creating an awareness that is rooted in mostly fact. They also publish news from other High factual sources such as Reuters, Washington Post and Time.\nA factual search reveals that the Global Slavery Index has not failed a fact check. In fact, they are used by IFCN fact checkers as a source for slavery information.\nOverall, we rate the Global Slavery Index Least Biased based on reporting stats and facts about slavery that is supported by a methodology. We also rate them high for factual reporting due to being used by fact checkers as a resource and the use of proper sources in news stories. (D. Van Zandt 3/12/2018) Updated (2/1/2019)",

However, they source poorly through quoting rather than providing any links to back their claims. The North Korea Times also republishes full articles from Voice of America, Asian News International and other mostly least biased sources.\nThe North Korea Times is not a North Korean news source. They simply report news about North Korea that comes from mostly least biased international sources.  \nOverall, we rate the North Korea Times Least Biased based on neutral wording and republishing from other least biased sources.

Political Storm features writers from both the right and left and yes they do convey bias. We give this source a least bias rating because they do cover both sides by allowing public debate on the issues. In the articles reviewed today all were well sourced to factual information regardless of their individual bias. However, many articles did tend to favor the right. When using this source take each article individually rather than judging the source as a whole. (D. Van Zandt 4/10/2017)",

            "notes": "History\nFounded in 2007, by two former Washington Post Journalists, John F. Harris and Jim VandeHei, Politico is a news and opinion website based in Virginia, USA. Currently, John F. Harris is the editor-in-chief of Politico. In 2016, Jim VandeHei left Politico and now is the co-founder and CEO of Axios. Politico describes its vision as “Politico strives to be the dominant source for politics and policy in power centers across every continent where access to reliable information, non-partisan journalism and real-time tools creates, informs and engages a global citizenry.” It distributes content via the internet, the Politico newspaper, radio, and podcasts. Its coverage in Washington, D.C., includes the U.S. Congress, lobbying, media and the presidency. Politico also has its own bi-monthly magazine that covers politics, news and opinions. \nFunded by / Ownership\nRobert  L. Allbritton is the Publisher and Executive Chairman of Politico. Allbritton is also the owner of Capitol News Company, which owns Politico as well as its sister company, CapNY. Politico has a subscription based service called Politico Pro, launched in 2010 for professionals, such as lobbyists and analysts, which provides policy intelligence coverage on technology, energy and other sectors. Politico.com does not require a subscription and their print newspaper is available for free in locations throughout Washington D.C., however outside of DC and overseas it is subject to a subscription fee. Both the website and print editions feature advertising.\nAnalysis / Bias\nBoth sides of the political spectrum have accused Politico of either having a left or right bias. For example, Media Matters for America, a progressive media watchdog group in Washington, has accused Politico of having a “Republican tilt.” Politico also published an article criticizing Obama for not being a strong supporter of Israel: “Obama’s Jewish Problem”. In another article Politico states that Liberals are not as tolerant as they say they are: “Why Liberals Aren’t as Tolerant as They Think.” Further, here is an article criticizing Democratic Socialism: “Down Goes Socialism” and another criticizing Bernie Sanders, “Bernie’s army in disarray.” Lastly, according to the Poynter Institute, Politico is balanced.\nThe right leaning Daily Caller has also criticized Politico for having a liberal bias when they compared a New York Times headline to Politico’s Playbook headline, by claiming that it “Extended further to the left than the NYT on this headline.” \nIn review, Politico occasionally publishes listicles such as “All of Trump’s Russia Ties, in 7 Charts.” They also publish articles with minimally loaded words such as “Ocasio-Cortez warns Trump Jr. about subpoena power in response to meme”, and they source to credible media outlets such as Reuters and the NY Times. However, they sometimes do use emotional headlines such as this: Establishment looks to crush liberals on Medicare for All.\nEditorially, Politico provides a balance of opinions as evidenced by the criticism they have received from both sides. Further, their news articles tend to be balanced through covering both sides and counterpoints to the story they are reporting on.\nA factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.\nOverall, we rate Politico Least Biased based on balanced coverage of news stories and High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing and a clean fact check record.

They publish original statements and their evaluations on the PolitiFact.com website, and assign each a “Truth-O-Meter” rating. The ratings range from “True” for completely accurate statements to “Pants on Fire” (from the taunt “Liar, liar, pants on fire”) for false and ridiculous claims. In 2018, Politifact became affiliated with the Poynter Institute.\nFunded by / Ownership\nAccording to their about page “In 2018, PolitiFact was acquired by the Poynter Institute, a nonprofit school for journalists. While PolitiFact relies on administrative support from the Poynter Institute, it is otherwise financially self-sustaining. PolitiFact receives support from online advertising, as well as revenue generated through content partnerships and from grants.”\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, Politifact has been called left biased by some right leaning sources. In fact, there is a source called Politifact Bias that is dedicated to pointing out Politifact’s biases. Politifact is also a signatory of the International Fact Checking Network (IFCN), which outlines a code principles for credible fact checkers.\nPolitifact uses minimal loaded language in their articles and headlines such as this: Trump falsely claims NATO countries owe United States money for defense spending. All information is well sourced to credible media and/or direct statements from experts in the field or the politicians themselves. Fact Check selection leans slightly left as more right wing politicians are currently fact checked. This may be due to bias or the fact that Republicans currently control all branches of government and hence there is more to check. In fact, there was a recent academic study done that shows Politifact employs minimal bias through wording.\nOverall, this update reveals a slight leftward shift in Politifact’s fact checking selection, but not enough to move them from the least biased category.

            "notes": "History\nFounded in 1851, Reuters is the world’s leading international multimedia news agency. It is headquartered in London, United Kingdom. Reuters was founded by Paul Julius Reuter, a German-born immigrant, who moved to London and opened an office that transmitted stock market quotations between London and Paris via the new Calais-Dover cable. He had previously used pigeons to fly stock prices between Aachen and Brussels, which was also a common way to dispatch news. However, the Agence Havas (the predecessor of today’s AFP) was the first to start using the Morse telegraph. According to an article titled ”CHRONOLOGY: Reuters, from pigeons to multimedia merger”, overland telegraph and undersea cables enabled Reuters to expand its service beyond Europe to the Far East in 1872 and South America by 1874. During both World Wars, Reuters came under pressure from the British government to serve British interests. In 1941 Reuters avoided this pressure by restructuring itself as a private company. Stephen J. Adler is the President and Editor-in-Chief of Reuters.\nFunded by / Ownership\nIn April 2008, British company Reuters Group was acquired by Thomson Corporation and formed Thomson Reuters. Reuters is the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, which is the world’s leading source of intelligent information for businesses and professionals and is owned by The Woodbridge Company Limited, which owns approximately 62.35% of common shares and is the principal and controlling shareholder of Thomson Reuters – see Fact Book 2017 (pg 83) and Annual Report 2017. The Woodbridge Company Limited is based in Toronto, Canada. The chief executive officer of Thomson Reuters is James (Jim) C. Smith, and the chairman is David Thomson, who is also a Chairman of Woodbridge. \nAnalysis / Bias\nIn 2018, Reuters was named the winner of two Pulitzer Prizes on international reporting for exposing the methods of police killing squads in Rodrigo Duterte’s war on drugs and for feature photography documenting the Rohingya refugee crisis in Myanmar and Bangladesh.\nIn review, when covering Trump administration news, Reuters Editor In Chief wrote this message to staff “Covering Trump the Reuters Way” urging them to stick with the Reuters “Trust Principles.” However, after the Capital Gazette shooting, Reuters Breaking news editor Rob Cox tweeted “This is what happens when @realDonaldTrump calls journalists the enemy of the people. Blood is on your hands, Mr. President. Save your thoughts and prayers for your empty soul.” Cox later apologized and deleted the tweet. Regarding the incident Steve Adler, Editor-in-Chief, published a statement regarding Rob Cox’s tweet stating “Mr. Cox’s actions were inconsistent with the Thomson Reuters Trust Principles requiring journalists to maintain freedom from bias. We do not condone his behavior and will take appropriate action.” \nIn reporting, Reuters uses minimally biased emotional language in their headlines such as “Oregon right-wingers clash with anti-fascists at march in Portland” and “Trump lawyer Cohen vows to defend himself, puts family first: ABC News”, sourcing credible local sources such as the Oregonian newspaper and ABC news. In most cases Reuters journalists are the primary source of stories and consistently report with minimal bias, covering both sides of issues.\nA factual search reveals that Reuters has an excellent track record with fact checkers.\nOverall, we rate Reuters Least Biased based on objective reporting and Very High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing of information with minimal bias.

It is a resource for validating and debunking such stories in American popular culture. Snopes ownership has said that the site receives more complaints of liberal bias than conservative bias, but insists that the same debunking standards are applied to all political claims and urban legends.\nFunded by / Ownership\nAccording to their about page, Snopes.com is an independent publication owned by Snopes Media Group. Snopes derives funding from online advertising as well as donations. They fully disclose funding and expenses, as well as listing any donation over $10,000. For example, they list that Facebook paid them $100,000 and the James Randi Educational Foundation awarded them $75,000.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn 2012, FactCheck.org reviewed a sample of Snopes’ responses to political rumors regarding George W. Bush, Sarah Palin, and Barack Obama, and found them to be free from bias in all cases. Critics of the site have made the false claim that the website is funded by billionaire philanthropist George Soros, which has been debunked many times as they are funded through advertising and donations, in which they disclose.\nIn review, Snopes is a signatory of the International Fact Checking Network (IFCN) that is run by the Poynter Institute. Snopes has been independently verified by the IFCN, which lists its core principles as: “non-partisanship and fairness, transparency of sources, transparency of funding and organization, transparency of methodology, and open and honest corrections policy.” Snopes meets this criteria, along with 50+ other fact checkers world wide. Of note, Media Bias Fact Check only uses IFCN fact checkers when checking claims and evaluating sources.\nSnopes always openly sources their information and avoids emotional wording, though they do occasionally publish news stories that offer some opinions. Snopes is frequently accused of liberal bias by some on the right. For example, the Daily Express of the UK and the Daily Caller have both criticized Snopes for fact checks they felt were wrong or biased against the right. According to research performed by Real Clear Politics in the article: Snopes and Editorializing Fact Checks, they determined that out of the six fact checkers working with Facebook, “that Snopes is the least likely to fact-check matters of opinion.” This is important because opinion is something that cannot be fact checked. The article went on to say “We have found that since we started our project, Snopes has fact-checked opinions only 2 percent of the time. In other words, 98 percent of the time it sticks to matters of verifiable fact. Such an achievement is even more remarkable given that during this period, Snopes has produced the second-most articles of the six fact-checking outfits.”\nFinally, MBFC has an article detailing why we rate Snopes least biased that you can view here.\nOverall, we rate Snopes Least Biased and High for factual reporting based on transparency and proper sourcing of information.

SCMP.com is a subscription-only service and after being acquired by Alibaba Group, SCMP’s narrative became more pro-China, but still low in bias. However, when reporting local news The South China Morning Post publishes stories that are neutral in wording, while citing both sides equally. For example in this article the South China Morning Post covers both sides of the debate equally without interjecting opinions. When reporting U.S. news there is left leaning bias due to their viewpoint that correlates with U.S. left. Overall, we rate SCMP as factual in reporting, very slightly left leaning and least biased on a whole. (M. Huitsing 8/4/2017)",

The founder of NY1 is Richard Aurelio, who at the time was the president of New York City’s Time Warner Cable. Spectum News – NY1 is currently owned by Charter Communications, Inc.. NY1 serves Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island and provides 24-hour local news, politics, weather news and more. NY1 is headquartered in Manhattan, New York City and shares content with its sister channels in the Spectrum News Networks family: New York; in Austin and San Antonio, Texas; in Charlotte, Greensboro and Raleigh, North Carolina; and in Tampa and Orlando, Florida.\nFormer political reporter for the New York Post and the Associated Press, Bob Hardt is the Political Director of NY1.\nFunded by / Ownership\nTime Warner Cable launched its first regional cable news channel on September 8, 1992, with the rollout of the New York City based NY1. In 2013, Charter Communications announced that they are re-branding its residential services to Charter Spectrum. In 2016, Charter acquired Time Warner Cable. Next, Time Warner Cable was phased out in favor of Spectrum, the brand used by Charter to market its services. The main revenue sources for NY1 are ads and subscription fees collected by cable operators who package programs in “bundles.“\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, Spectrum News – NY1 reports local news with minimal loaded words and bias such as “Posters send message on immigration concerns across Queens”. NY1 also republishes Associated Press articles and covers stories with both points of view represented. Typically, NY1 utilizes credible sources such as the Associated Press, however they also source through interviews and large quotes as well.\nA factual search reveals NY1 has not failed a fact check.\nOverall, we rate Spectrum News – NY1 Least Biased due to representing both viewpoints and using minimally loaded words and factually high based on proper sourcing.

According to their about page The Economist “is neither right nor left but a blend of the two, drawing on the classical liberalism of the 19th century and coming from what we like to call the radical centre.”\nFunded by / Ownership\nThe Economist is owned by the Economist Group, which is a British multinational media company. The Economist Group is primary owned by the Cadbury, Rothschild, Schroder, Layton and Agnelli families. The Economist is funded through subscriptions, advertising and sponsored content.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, The Economist takes an editorial stance of classical and economic liberalism that supports free trade, globalization, open immigration, and social liberalism. There is minimal use of loaded language in both headlines and articles such as this: America’s new attitude towards China is changing the countries’ relationship. In fact, most articles are well written with very low emotional bias. Economically, The Economist leans right, but they also support such initiatives as a carbon tax and environmental protectionism, which are not right wing positions. Editorially, The Economist endorses both Republicans and Democrats in the United States. For example, the have endorsed Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton in 2016, while endorsing Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush in earlier elections. In the UK they most recently endorsed the Liberal Democrats, which hold left leaning libertarian positions. One criticism of The Economist is that a majority of their articles are penned anonymously, which they explain is to maintain a continuity of writing. They do however, provide a media directory where you can view who is involved in writing and editing.\nA factual search reveals that The Economist has never failed a fact check.\nOverall, we rate The Economist Least Biased based on balanced reporting and High for factual reporting due to a clean fact check record.

They really don’t publish much about politics, so there really isn’t any bias to determine. Since they pick such a wide range of stories there does not appear to be any bias there either. They are simply publishing popular stories. The only criticism of this website is that they sometimes source questionable science sources and other times pseudoscience. Other than that this is a low biased and mostly factual website. While some of the content is questionable there really isn’t any bias applied and not enough to place this source in the Conspiracy/Pseudoscience Category. I would suggest fact checking articles on an individual basis from this source. \nOverall, we rate Viral Thread Least Biased, but borderline Conspiracy/Pseudoscience when it comes to facts.

The current president is Hank Campbell.\nFunded by / Ownership\nThe ACSH is a nonprofit (501(c)(3) that is primarily funded through donations. They disclaim on the website: “ACSH does not accept government grants or contracts, nor do we have an endowment. We raise our funds each year primarily from individuals and foundations.”\nAnalysis / Bias\nThe ACSH is known to be funded by corporations and tends to lean toward anti-environment issues. Though not scientifically wrong they exhibit a bias in favor of businesses. \nSome of the products ACSH has defended over the years include DDT, asbestos, and Agent Orange, as well as common pesticides. ACSH has often called environmentalists and consumer activists “terrorists,” arguing that their criticisms and concerns about potential health and environmental risks are threats to society.\nACSH has been funded by big agri-businesses and trade groups like Kellogg, General Mills, Pepsico, and the American Beverage Association, among others. \nA factual search reveals that the American Council on Science and Health has not failed a fact check.\nOverall, we rate ACSH Right-Center Biased based on pro-business support and High for factual reporting due to a clean fact check record.

It was founded as the Charles Koch Foundation in 1974 by Ed Crane, Murray Rothbard, and Charles Koch.  In July 1976, the name was changed to the Cato Institute. The mission of the Cato Institute is to originate, disseminate, and increase understanding of public policies based on the principles of individual liberty, limited government, free markets, and peace.\nFunded by / Ownership\nThe Cato Institute is a 501(c)(3) Non-profit think tank who’s current CEO and President is Peter N. Goettler. According to their about page “Cato receives approximately 80 percent of its funding through tax-deductible contributions from individuals, many of whom are responding to informative direct mail solicitations and program updates.” Cato offers an annual report that shows the percentages of money received as well as their IRS 990 form. The Cato institute is funded by a wide variety of organizations including Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, Charles Koch Foundation and Sarah Scaife Foundation.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, The Cato Institute is a right leaning Libertarian think thank that advocates for privatizing many aspects of Government, such as schools and social security. Cato is also opposed to Campaign Finance Reform and often is criticized for climate change denial. While Cato advocates for right wing economic policies, they support socially liberal positions such as Gay Marriage, Marijuana Legalization and liberalized immigration.\nCato Institute uses moderately loaded language in their headlines and articles such as this: The Myth of the Cyber Offense: The Case for Restraint. This article, like most on Cato, is very well researched and sourced properly. However, on the side bar of the website they offer curated news from other sources that generally leans right such as the National Review and the factually mixed Federalist. Story selection typically revolves around limited government issues with a strong emphasis on free market capitalism.\nWhen it comes to science, Cato Institute often publishes misleading or false information regarding climate science. While Cato does not deny that global warming is occurring and influenced by humans they also minimize the impact, which does not coincide with the consensus of science. Here is Cato’s position on Global Warming: “Global warming is indeed real, and human activity has been a contributor since 1975. But global warming is also a very complicated and difficult issue that can provoke very unwise policy in response to political pressure. Although there are many different legislative proposals for substantial reductions in carbon dioxide emissions, there is no operational or tested suite of technologies that can accomplish the goals of such legislation. Fortunately, and contrary to much of the rhetoric surrounding climate change, there is ample time to develop such technologies, which will require substantial capital investment by individuals.” This position has led to criticism.\nA factual search reveals a few failed fact checks.\n\n“There has been no net global warming for over a decade now.” – FALSE\n“Common welfare programs give income of $43,330 or $20.83 an hour.” – MOSTLY FALSE\n\nOverall, we rate the Cato Institute Right-Center Biased. While Cato’s economic and environmental positions are strongly right, they also hold liberal positions through immigration and social liberty issues. In whole, this places them Right-Center as we weigh economic theory more heavily in the overall score. We also rate them Mixed for factual reporting due to misleading statements on climate change as well as some failed fact checks. (7/12/2016) Updated (D. Van Zandt 1/23/2018)",

            "notes": "History\nAccording to their about page “Just Facts Daily is a project of Just Facts, a nonprofit institute dedicated to researching and publishing verifiable facts about public policy. Just Facts Daily typically covers topics that have not been accurately and thoroughly covered by other organizations.” The website does not list an editor, but it is known to be edited by James D. Agresti.\nFunded by / Ownership\nJust Facts Daily is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization owned by James D. Agresti. Just Facts Daily does not have advertising and is funded through donations.\nAnalysis / Bias\nJust Facts Daily (JFD) is a news, opinion and fact checking website with a right-center bias in reporting. JFD’s tagline is “Be Informed, Not Just Opinionated.” This website is certainly informative, but it also appears to be quite opinionated. \nFirst, lets look at factual reporting. We could not find any evidence of JFD making certified false claims. Each article is also impeccably sourced to credible information to convey their narrative. Therefore, we rate them high for factual reporting. The right-center bias designation comes from multiple factors. First, there is excessive use of loaded emotional words in the headlines. The following loaded words (words that attempt to influence through positive or negative emotion) were found in the first 15 headlines: Incompetent, Dishonest, Catastrophically, Deceitful, Brazen Lie, Smearing, Deadly Falsehoods. Most of these words appeared in headlines when the topic was about liberal politicians or liberal policy. Further, the headlines that described conservative policy did not contain these negative connotations. They were mostly neutral in wording.\nIn order to keep this short I will discuss only one article. The article is entitled “Clinton and Obama’s Brazen Lie About the Iraq Withdrawal.” The loaded language, “Brazen Lie” does not fit the content of the article. Clinton and Obama cite the SOFA agreement as the reason for our troop withdrawal from Iraq in 2011. This is true and not a brazen lie. There is however, more to the story and JFD did a good job of showing that they could have legally extended the troops time in Iraq, but chose not too. Overall, the article is well sourced and for the most part is accurate. The bias is conveyed through the author’s attempt to show that Obama and Clinton are mostly responsible for the rise of ISIS, due to abiding to the SOFA agreement signed by former President Bush. In 2011, at the time of the troop withdrawal, ISIS was not considered a threat and it could not be predicted that they would increase in size and strength in such a short period of time. Essentially, the entire article is an attempt to blame the Obama administration for something that was unforeseen at the time.\nIn summary, this is a factual website from a sourcing standpoint and impressively researched. It does however convey a right leaning bias through story selection that is more favorable toward conservative causes and more negative toward liberal policy. There is also extensive use of loaded negative emotional words when describing the left. This is the opposite approach that a fact checker should take, when instead they should be using neutral language. We rate this source Right-Center Biased. \nIt should be noted that Just Facts Daily wrote a negative article regarding Media Bias Fact Check that was based on a review by a former reviewer, who is no longer affiliated with our organization.

            "notes": "History\nFounded in 1801 by Alexander Hamilton (One of the Founding Fathers of the United States), the New York Post (NY Post) is a daily tabloid newspaper from New York City. According to an article published by the NY Times, titled “THE NEW YORK POST HAS A LONG HISTORY”, they describe how under Hamilton’s ownership the paper covered “shipping news, engaged in political crusades even if it meant the loss of advertising revenue.” Later owners were Poet William Cullen Bryant who kept the NY Post for 50 years, followed by railroad magnate Henry Villard (1878), Oswald Garrison Villard (1917), Thomas W. Lamond, and Cyrus H. K. Curtis (1920). Under Curtis’ ownership the NY Post followed a conservative editorial policy until 1936. \nWhen David J.Stern acquired the paper in 1936, they became editorially more liberal. Dorothy Schiff bought the New York Post in 1939, which she controlled until 1976, and under her ownership, The Post was liberal as it supported the civil rights movement and opposed the Vietnam War. In 1942, Theodore Thackrey became editor and The Post switched from a broadsheet paper to a tabloid. \nIn 1976, Rupert Murdoch, the owner of News Corp, acquired The New York Post and in 1988, Murdoch sold the paper to Real estate developer Peter S. Kalikow. When Kalikow lost the paper to bankruptcy in 1993, Rupert Murdoch once again purchased the paper and continues to own it today. Since Murdoch took over the paper, The Post has been known for their over-the-top sensational headlines.\nFunded by / Ownership\nThe New York Post is currently owned by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp, which owns many conservative/sensational media outlets around the world. The paper is funded through advertising, subscriptions and newsstand sales.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, the New York Post tends to publish stories utilizing sensationalized headlines with emotionally loaded wording such as “Cop cold-cocks unarmed man ‘acting irate’ at restaurant”, and “It’s time for Bill Clinton to take a walk in the Chappaqua woods.” The New York Post also republishes news from other sources such as the least biased Associated Press. In general, more stories favor the right, but the NY Post does not shy away from reporting negative coverage of the right, if it is a big story. They also tend to source their information properly, however many times the headline misleadingly exaggerates the actual story they are reporting.\nEditorially, The Post has endorsed the Republican Presidential Candidate in every race since 1980. However, in 2016 they did not offer an endorsement for the Presidential election to either candidate.\nAccording to an LA Times article, the New York Post was reported to be the preferred newspaper of U.S. President Donald Trump, who maintains frequent contact with its owner, Rupert Murdoch. The Post, According to a survey conducted by Pace University in 2004, was rated the least-credible major news outlet in New York. Further, The Post has been criticized since the beginning of Murdoch’s ownership for “sensationalism, blatant advocacy, and conservative bias.”\nA factual search reveals several failed checks.\n\nMostly False: Ted Cruz ‘same senator who once supported a ban on sex toys’ – Mostly False\nNewly Discovered Planet Could Destroy Earth Any Day Now – False\nHillary Clinton Regularly Had Her Maid Print Classified Documents – Unproven\nPS 169 Pledge of Allegiance and Holiday Ban Controversy – Mostly False\n\nOverall we rate the New York Post on the far end of Right-Center Biased due to story selection that typically favors the Right and Mixed (borderline questionable) for factual reporting based on several failed fact checks.

The current editor is Michelle Richardson.\nFunded by / Ownership\nThe Ottawa Citizen is owned by the Postmedia Network, which owns several right leaning papers throughout Canada, with their flagship paper being the National Post. The Ottawa Citizen is funded through advertising and subscriptions.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, the Ottawa Citizen covers local news via journalists and national news via The Canadian Press and International news through a variety of sources such as Bloomberg for business news, Associated Press and The Telegraph. All information is properly sourced to credible media outlets. \nEditorially, there is more negative articles regarding liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau than positive. While the Ottawa Citizen does criticize President Trump they do so lightly. In general, more stories favor the right editorially than the left, but there is a reasonable balance.\nA factual search reveals the Ottawa Citizen has not failed a fact check.\nOverall, we rate the Ottawa Citizen Right-Center biased based on some favoritism toward right leaning politics and High for factual reporting due to a clean fact check record.

When reporting India national news, they are pro-right government due to their affiliation with political parties. In general stories pertaining to India are highly biased toward the right leaning Government.\nOverall, we rate Republic World Right-Center biased based on international reporting that slightly leans left and Right biased for Indian national news reporting. Therefore, on a whole, we place them Right-Center. We also rate this source mixed for factual reporting based on poor sourcing. (M. Huitsing 9/6/2017) Updated (11/14/2018)",

David Pecker, who owns American Media, Inc. joined the Postmedia board, and then resigned from the board of Postmedia in 2018, due to his involvement of hush payments on behalf of his “friends” including President Trump and Harvey Weinstein.\nAccording to the National Observer, PostMedia is in a downward spiral. After Postmedia announced a $1.4M loss for the last quarter of 2018, Paul Godfrey stepped down as CEO of the Postmedia Network and was replaced by Andrew MacLeod, as of 1/10/2019. Godfrey, will remain as executive chair. Godfrey was also criticized for cutting 800 full-time jobs across Postmedia in 2016, while earning an annual salary of $1.7 million.

There is moderate use of loaded language that leans right such as this Trudeau braces for first ministers meeting, shaping up to be the most acrimonious in years and Trump fires back at Democrats who want to impeach him: ‘They know they can’t win in 2020’.

In general, story selection is relatively balanced with a slight lean to the right.\nEditorially, CEO Paul Godfrey, ordered all 16 major Postmedia papers, including the Vancouver Sun to endorse Stephen Harper of the Conservative Party, in the 2015 federal elections.\nA factual search reveals the Vancouver Sun has never failed a fact check. \nOverall, we rate the Vancouver Sun Right-Center biased based on editorial positions that lean right and High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing and a clean fact check record.

            "notes": "History\nLaunched in 1889, The Wall Street Journal is an International business newspaper concentrating on finance, investment and corporate news. It is headquartered in New York City. The newspaper was founded by journalists, Charles Dow, Edward Jones and Charles Bergstresser, together they established the Dow Jones & Company, which led to the founding of the The Wall Street Journal. They also began the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which was invented by Charles Dow and Dow’s editorials led to what became known as “Dow theory” of market analysis. According to The New Yorker columnist Ken Auletta’s article on November 3, 2003 and titled “Family Business”, after the death of Charles Dow on December 4, 1902, the company was bought by its Boston correspondent, Clarence Barron. After Barron died in 1928, the new owners were his stepdaughters, Jane and Martha. Jane Barron’s husband, Hugh Bancroft, then took over the Wall Street Journal. He later committed suicide and the company was left to the Journal’s editor, and since that time the Bancroft family has not had an active management role.\nCurrently, Robert Thomson is the chief executive of News Corp and the WSJ editor-in-chief‎ is ‎Matt Murray, who replaced Gerard Baker. According to Politico, Baker faced criticism internally over the paper’s Pro-Trump coverage.  ‎Paul A. Gigot is the the editorial page editor and Vice President of The Wall Street Journal. He is also a conservative political commentator for Fox News Channel.\n\nFunded by / Ownership\nIn 2007, The Bancroft family and relatives sold the Wall Street Journal to Rupert Murdoch for $5 billion dollars. Rupert Murdoch also purchased its parent company, Dow Jones & Co. through his company, News Corporation. The WSJ is funded through paid subscriptions and advertising.\nAnalysis / Bias\nThe Walls Street Journal hasn’t endorsed US political candidates since 1928, however they have been criticized for endorsing far right populist politicians abroad. For example in South America they all but endorsed far-right Congressman Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil’s presidential election. They have also written favorably about Chilean Dictator Augusto Pinochet. The WSJ has been strongly criticized for their pro-Trump coverage and according to The Atlantic, there was an alleged conflict about how to cover Trump, resulting in an opinion editor’s departure. \nIn review, the WSJ utilizes emotionally loaded language in their editorial headlines that favor the right, such as this: “Wrap It Up, Mr. Mueller Democratic dilemma: Impeach Trump for lying about sex?” They also frequently promote anti-climate change messages such as this: “The Phony War Against CO2.” Here is another example from an editorial on Trump’s position on climate change “Not the Climate Apocalypse: The EPA’s power rule won’t save coal and won’t poison the planet.” Further, IFCN fact checker Climate Feedback has cited numerous editorials in which the Wall Street Journal uses very low scientific credibility. The pro-science Climate Science & Policy Watch also has criticized the WSJ for rejection of the 97% consensus of climate scientists. Lastly, The Guardian has an article describing how the WSJ “peddles big oil propaganda,” while “disguising climate misinformation as opinion.”\nWhen reporting regular news the WSJ uses minimally loaded words such as this: China Agrees to Reduce Tariffs on U.S. Autos. News articles are also properly sourced to credible media outlets such as the Financial Times and Washington Post.\nA factual search reveals that the Wall Street Journal has never failed a fact check regarding news reporting, however, IFCN fact checker Climate Feedback has found numerous inaccuracies in the WSJ editorial department.\nOverall, we rate the Wall Street Journal Right-Center biased due to low biased news reporting in combination with a strongly right biased editorial stance. We also rate them factually Mixed due to anti-climate, anti-science stances and misleading editorials. (7/18/2016) Updated (M. Huitsing 12/11/2018)",

            "notes": "History\nLaunched in 1982, The Washington Times is a daily newspaper concentrating on politics and news. Based in Washington, D.C., The Washington Times was founded by a self-professed messiah, Korean Sun Myung Moon and according to its parent company, during Washington Times 20th anniversary, Moon said: “The Washington Times is responsible to let the American people know about God” and “The Washington Times will become the instrument in spreading the truth about God to the world.”\nLarry Beasley is the current president and CEO of The Washington Times and he will remain as The Times’ chief executive officer. According to a Washington Times article however, Christopher Dolan has been announced as the next president of The Washington Times, effective January 1st, 2019. Mr. Dolan also will retain his role as The Times’ top editor.\nFunded by / Ownership\nOperations Holdings Inc is the owner of The Washington Times, which is owned by the Unification Church of South Korea, through their holding company HSA-UWC (Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity). In 1954, Reverend Sun Myung Moon founded this religious movement in South Korea, which is known for its mass weddings and its members are referred to as “Moonies.” According to a Guardian article, former members have claimed that the Unification Church is religious cult that utilizes brainwashing techniques. The newspaper is funded through a subscription and advertising model.\nAnalysis / Bias\nThe Washington Times, although praised by conservative political leaders, has also been criticized for being the mouthpiece of the Unification Church. The Washington Times also has a strong pro- Christian bias, with a whole section dedicated to the Bible. They have also published articles that criticizes left leaning Christians such as this: “George Soros and his ‘rented evangelicals’ outed by Christian leaders.”\nIn review, The Washington Times utilizes emotionally loaded language in their headlines such as “Gowdy puts Comey on blast after FBI ex-chief’s snarky ‘search for the truth’ tweet” and “NBC News’ Mika Brzezinski problem.” When it comes to sourcing, The Washington Times re-publishes articles from the least biased Associated Press and occasionally utilizes credible sources such as Refinery29. In examining several articles, we found that The Times either does not source information at all, or they simply link back to themselves (internal linking) to information that is not relevant to the article. This article is a good example of internal linking: “Mueller: FBI did not mislead Flynn into lying.” Internal linking is a technique used to increase page views and improve SEO, thereby increasing advertising revenue. There is nothing wrong with internal linking if the link relates to relevent information, but in the case of The Times, it does not.\nWhen evaluating how The Times covers science, we found they published an analysis/opinion piece by L. Todd Wood that promotes a climate change conspiracy theory: “global warming and then the climate change narrative was cooked up by America’s adversaries to enable our enemies to eventually dominate us.” Further, according to IFCN fact checker Climate Feedback, The Washington Times published an article with very low scientific credibility. However, when covering straight news on climate change they report accurately as seen in this article: “Trump admin releases National Climate Assessment with dire warnings.” \nA factual search reveals that The Washington Times has failed two fact checks that can be read here and here.\nAlthough the Washington Times has a very strong right editorial bias, they report straight news with a much lower bias. Therefore, we rate them Right-Center biased overall, and factually mixed due to poor sourcing, holding editorial postition that are contrary to scientific consensus, and failed fact checks.

Julian Assange, an Australian Internet activist, is generally described as its founder, editor-in-chief, and director. Although it is believed that WikiLeaks publishing of classified/secret material is authentic they have been accused of promoting conspiracy theories against Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party of the United States (See Wikipedia).  So, while the material dumps are unaltered and not biased they have demonstrated a political agenda through the information they choose to dump, which some believe tends to favor Russia.  Further, The National Intelligence Council has found evidence of Wikileaks collaborating with Russian Government sponsored media outlet, Russia Today. Recently reports have surfaced that Julian Assange had direct e-mail contact with the Trump campaign. While we can’t say the information Wikileaks dumps is not factual, we can state that there is at least a right of center bias in whom these leaks tend to benefit. We also rate them Mixed for factual reporting based on selective leaks that result in spin. (11/19/2016) Updated (D. Van Zandt 11/17/2017)",

We are road warriors fighting the good fight for journalism.” They further state that “All stories on Big League Politics are factually accurate.” \nFunded by / Ownership\nIn early 2018, Big League Politics was acquired by Mustard Seed Media, a company run by a political consultant who previously worked for Moore’s campaign. Funding is not disclosed, but appears to be through online advertising.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn reviewing articles on the Big League Politics website it is clear that the sole mission is to promote the agenda of President Trump. Essentially, this could be classified as a propaganda media arm for the President. While there are nice examples of well sourced journalism on this website there are also unproven conspiracy type stories. For example, in one article the author is making the claim that Justice John Roberts was hacked by Obama officials as evidence of a Deep State conspiracy. The source of this audio is from two discredited public figures. In other stories, there is the use of conspiracy theorists as sources of information. In this story, they are relying on Infowars’ Alex Jones and fellow conspiracy theorist Roger Stone for information and opinion. Overall, the blog is well written, but with a strong right wing bias in story selection. Many stories are factual or at the very least rooted in fact, but there are some stories that are unproven with conclusions being drawn by the authors. These stories are propaganda at best and conspiracy theories at worst.\nA factual search reveals some failed fact checks.\nOverall, we rate Big League Politics strongly Right Biased based on story selection that favors the right and Mixed for factual reporting due to use of poor sources and promotion of conspiracy theories.

The website is funded through online advertising.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, Communities Digital News (CDN) reports on a variety of news including world and political news. CDN frequently uses very strong emotionally loaded words that denigrate the left, such as this: Saving the Republic from the lunatic left. This article does not offer a single source to back any of its many right biased claims, such as “Hillary Clinton, of all the criminally unhinged hypocrites”, and “Two years into his Presidency he is the most successful President of my lifetime.” While this is clearly a highly biased opinion piece it is not labeled as such and instead placed in their world news category. In another article, they promote the conspiracy theory that the Clinton’s are mass murderers: Clinton body count expands, MSM largely ignores death of Jen Moore. In this article they point to the Clinton’s “mounting pile of corpses littering the path to power and riches trod by Bill and Hillary Clinton.” Again, this highly charged conspiracy piece is very light on sourcing and there is zero evidence to support this claim.\nIn general, all stories favor the right and harshly denigrate the left with very poor sourcing techniques.\nA factual search reveals that CDN has not been fact checked by an IFCN Fact Checker.\nOverall, we rate Communities Digital News Right Biased based on story selection that always favors the Right and Mixed factually due to promotion of conspiracy theories and very poor sourcing.

Headlines contain moderately loaded words and almost all stories are pro-right and anti-left. Not all articles are accurate or they are simply misleading. For example, there is a story on March 20th, 2017 entitled “Think Tank Report: Trump’s First 50 Days a Major Victory for Americans.” In this article they make various evidence based claims about President Trump’s accomplishments in the first 50 days. While what they list is factually accurate from a numbers standpoint, most of it has nothing to do with Trump. Here are some examples:\n“In both January and February, U.S. companies added jobs to the economy by leaps and bounds. In January, the numbers were 238,000 jobs added, and in February the figures were 235,000, with wages growing by an average 2.8 percent and unemployment falling to 4.7 percent.”\nThese numbers are correct, but January job growth is credited to Obama and is the same growth our economy has been experiencing for 6 straight years. This has nothing to do with Trump.\n“The most recent figure for the debt under ex-President Obama was $19.947 trillion, but since then, Trump has subtracted $68 billion — not a bad start for a president who has vowed to cut copious government waste.”\nThis also has nothing to do with Trump as his budget will not begin until October 2017. These are Obama’s numbers until that time. This is mostly false.\n“Since Trump was elected, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has surged more than 12 percent — greater than 2500 points — to close above 21,000 for the first time ever on March 1.”\nWhile these numbers are again accurate, they ignore the fact that the stock market has grown consistently since 2009. While some of this may be attributed to enthusiasm for Trump, one cannot claim he did it alone.\nOverall, we give Conservative Base a right bias rating vs. questionable…But it is close. (D.

It was founded by Tucker Carlson, a libertarian conservative political pundit, and Neil Patel, former adviser to former Vice President Dick Cheney. The current editor-in-chief is Geoff Ingersol.\nFunded by / Ownership\nThe Daily Caller is owned by The Daily Caller, Inc., which does not list its ownership or members. The website was initially launched after raising $3 million in funding from businessman Foster Friess. Currently, the Daily Caller is funded through native online advertising, averaging 30 million+ page views per month.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, The Daily Caller is a strongly right leaning news and opinion website that has been involved with publishing controversial and false stories. For example, they routinely publish misleading or false information regarding climate change that goes against the consensus of science. The Daily Caller has also published articles by Jason Kessler, a white supremacist who organized a rally of hundreds of white nationalists in Charlottesville. They subsequently scrubbed those articles after the Charlottesville vehicular homicide incident.\nThe Daily Caller frequently uses loaded emotional language that typically favors the right such as this: DEM NOMINEE FOR FLORIDA GOVERNOR IS PROGRESSIVE MAYOR WITH CORRUPTION INVESTIGATION SWIRLING AROUND HIM. The Daily Caller usually sources their information to credible media outlets, but sometimes they utilize sources that are factually mixed such as the Daily Wire and Questionable sources such as Judicial Watch. In reviewing story content, virtually all favored the right in story selection and wording, while denigrating the left. The Daily Caller also promotes a favorable view of President Donald Trump through promotion of his policies.\nA factual search reveals a very poor track record with fact checking. Here is a short list of some failed fact checks:\n\n“Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed ‘watered-down’ HIV/AIDS drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa.” – FALSE\n“Jeanne Shaheen was principally involved in a plot with Lois Lerner and President Barack Obama’s political appointee at the IRS to lead a program of harassment against conservative nonprofit groups during the 2012 election” – FALSE\nGeorge Soros-controlled Smartmatic manufactures the voting machines used in 16 crucial states, and those states will be rigged in favor of Hillary Clinton. – FALSE\nIndiana Muslims are appalled by a billboard displaying a list of deeds by the Prophet Muhammad even though it is accurate. – MOSTLY FALSE\nWashington state has updated their curriculum standards to include teaching “transgenderism” to Kindergarteners. – MOSTLY FALSE\n\nThe Daily Caller has failed numerous fact checks, however they post a significant amount of articles each day. Based on the volume of articles published, versus failed fact checks, they do not fall into the Questionable category, though they are close.\nOverall, we rate the Daily Caller strongly right biased based on story selection that almost always favors the right and Mixed for factual reporting due to numerous failed fact checks. The Daily Caller is a source that needs to be fact checked on a per article basis. (7/19/2016) Updated (D. Van Zandt 8/29/2018)",

This article is critical of President Trump’s decision to leave Syria, arguing that pulling out will result in “at some point having to fight them again on U.S. soil.” In other words, the Daily Signal supports a more right leaning interventionist Neoconservative military approach.

FNC is available in 90 million homes and it operates the Fox Business Network and Fox News Radio. Fox also owns the National Geographic Channel, both the U.S. and international versions. Fox News Channel is headquartered in New York, NY.\nFox News Channel was created by Australian born American media mogul Rupert Murdoch and former Republican political consultant Roger Ailes is the founding CEO. Roger Ailes was forced to resign in 2016 amid multiple accusations of sexual harassment. Jay Wallace was promoted to president of the network and Suzanne Scott has been named CEO of Fox News as of May 2018. She will report to Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan Murdoch. Lachlan Murdoch, is the executive chairman and co-chairman of News Corp and 21st Century Fox (FOXA). On May 7, 2018, Comcast announced a potential bid, making a $65 billion cash offer challenging Disney’s offer for Fox.\nAs of October 2018, Fox News has added to their terms of use that they are an entertainment company: “Company furnishes the Company Sites and the Company Services for your personal enjoyment and entertainment.”\nFunded by / Ownership\nThe company is owned by Rupert Murdoch who is a board member of News Corp 21st Century Fox. James Murdoch (son) is chief executive of 21st Century Fox and recently left in May 2018 according to Reuters. Lachlan (the other son of Murdoch) and Rupert Murdoch will serve as co-chairmens of the new Fox. Revenue analysis can be found at Investopedia and income reports here.  \nAnalysis / Bias\nAccording to a Pew Research Center survey “Fox News was the main source for 40% of Trump voters” during the 2016 election. Further, another Pew Survey indicates “When it comes to choosing a media source for political news, conservatives orient strongly around Fox News. Nearly half of consistent conservatives (47%) name it as their main source for government and political news.”  \nFox News typically looks at the issues from a conservative perspective and also has a number of on air personalities that are strong supporters of Trump, such as Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham, and Tomi Lahren. Fox News typically skews conservative as there is less criticism of Trump, therefore the majority of stories are pro-Trump. \nIn review, Fox News publishes stories with emotionally loaded headlines such as “’They Wanted It to Blow Up’: Limbaugh Says Success of Trump-Kim Summit Caught Media Off Guard” and “Tucker: 2016 Russia Collusion ‘Witch Hunt’ Now Extends to Jill Stein.” When it comes to sourcing they typically utilize pro-Trump pundits such as Rush Limbaugh who has a very poor record with fact checkers, as well as credible sources such as the Wall Street Journal. Fox News is also known to publish right wing conspiracy theories, although after being sued they retracted the story. Fox News has also been deemed the least accurate cable news source according to Politifact.\nOverall, we rate Fox News strongly Right-Biased due to wording and story selection that favors the right and Mixed factually based on poor sourcing and the spreading of conspiracy theories that later must be retracted after being widely shared.

            "notes": "History\nFounded in 1973 by Joseph Coors (Coors Brewery), The Heritage Foundation is an American conservative think tank based in Washington, D.C. The foundation took a leading role in the conservative movement during the presidency of Ronald Reagan, whose policies were taken from Heritage’s policy study Mandate for Leadership.  Heritage has since continued to have a significant influence in U.S. public policy making, and is considered to be one of the most influential conservative research organizations in the United States.\nThe Heritage Foundation has been described as a major influence on the presidential transition of Donald Trump and the Trump administration. The foundation had a powerful say in the staffing of the administration, with CNN noting during the transition that “no other Washington institution has that kind of footprint in the transition.”\nThe Heritage Foundation also publishes the conservative news website, Daily Signal.\nFunded by / Ownership\nThe Heritage Foundation is a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization. Heritage’s initial funding was provided by Joseph Coors, of the Coors beer empire, and Richard Mellon Scaife, heir of the Mellon industrial and banking fortune. The Heritage Foundation provides current financial information that you can view here. The Heritage Foundation currently receives funding through individual donations as well as grants from conservative organizations such as the Koch Family Foundations, Marlboro cigarette manufacture’s parent company Altria and the Bradley Foundation.  The Wall Street Journal also reported that between 1993 and 1996, heritage received almost $1 million from the Korea Foundation, which reportedly “serves as a direct conduit of money from the South Korean government.” A look at campaign donations by Heritage shows that 96%, since 1990 have gone to Republican candidates and causes.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, The Heritage Foundation website does not report straight news, but rather provides commentary by conservative writers. Typically, there is minimal use of loaded language such as this: Green New Deal Would Barely Change Earth’s Temperature. Here Are the Facts. They also provide in-depth research such as this: Part I: Mental Illness, Firearms, And Violence. This report is sourced appropriately to a wide variety of credible sources. While this report is minimizing the lack of restrictions on guns as the culprit for gun deaths, it does provide an evidence based conclusion that “Serious Mental Illness Plays a Significant Role in Violent and Firearm-Specific Crime that Should Not Be Ignored.”\nThe Heritage Foundation has been criticized for taking positions that are favorable to the tobacco industry as well as for blocking action on climate change.\nOverall, we rate the Heritage Foundation Right Biased based on conservative policy positions as well as funding from right leaning organizations. We also rate them Mixed for factual reporting due to promoting misleading claims regarding global warming and the health dangers associated with tobacco. (7/19/2016) Updated (D. Van Zandt 2/9/2019)",

The publication continues to use the Investor’s Business Daily name as it continues to publish daily on its website.

They also report on politics, especially through their editorial section with a very strong right wing bias. There is moderate use of loaded language in their articles that significantly favors the right, such as this: Democratic Socialism: Who Knew That ‘Free’ Could Cost So Much? For the most part IBD sources their market information to credible mainstream and government websites, however they occasionally utilize factually mixed sources such as the Daily Signal.\nInvestors Business Daily strays from the consensus of science in regards to climate change and they have made outrageous and false claims, such as Stephen Hawking would be dead if he lived under England’s Government health care system. This is a false propaganda statement as Stephen Hawking is a citizen of the UK and lives there. Hawking claims the British Healthcare system saved his life and kept him alive to old age.\nA factual search reveals numerous failed fact checks by IFCN fact checkers. Here are a few of the many we found:\n\nIBD editorial board claims that cap-and-trade is unpopular in America – FALSE\nPrivate health insurance not banned on page 16 of the House bill – PANTS ON FIRE\nInvestor’s Business Daily editorial misrepresents study to claim plants will prevent dangerous climate change – FALSE\nWas it recently revealed that the U.S. found uranium in Iraq after the invasion in 2003 – FALSE\n\nOverall, we would rate Investors Business Daily Right Biased based on right leaning economic and market positions. We would also give them a High factual rating on strictly investing and market news.

The articles, however, are also heavily pro Israeli, which is to be expected, and by themselves they would only have earned JPC a Right Center rating. Where JPC earns its final rating, however, is in it’s reporting of Israeli related US news. As example, in the article “A New Realism: America & Israel in the Trump Era”, JPC praises Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capitol. A move that was met with alarm by the majority of world leaders, who believe it will impede peace talks. For it’s decidely right wing slant regarding US politics, JPC earns a Right Bias rating. (D.

It carries informational articles related to Judaism, dozens of syndicated columns written mostly by politically conservative writers, both Jewish and Gentile, advice columns on a number of issues, and cartoons. Jewish World Review has a right wing conservative bias in story selection and many times does not properly source information in articles. For example, in the article entitled: “REVEALED: The Obama administration’s support for Hamas was not passive,” there is not a single link to an external source to support the claim that Obama actively supported Hamas. Further, the author of this piece is from the Dave Horowitz Freedom Center, which is a far right wing anti-islam organization. (D. Van Zandt 3/4/2017)",

The Chairman and co-founder of Kansas Policy Institute is George Pearson. He is also a member of the Board of Directors of Atlas Network and he also served as a director for the Libertarian Cato Institute and the Institute for Humane Studies, among many other organizations. George Pearson according to a Politico article is a former member of the John Birch Society in Wichita, which has been described as a radical right organization that promotes conspiracies. In this article, sourcing a book written by Clayton A. Coppin, who is a researcher from George Mason University, summarizes Pearson’s arguments “It would be necessary to use ambiguous and misleading names, obscure the true agenda, and conceal the means of control. This is the method that Charles Koch would soon practice in his charitable giving, and later in his political actions.”\nDave Trabert is the President of the Kansas Policy Institute and according to Sourcewatch is a member of ALEC’s Tax and Fiscal Policy Task Force and Barry Poulson and Jonathan Williams both from KPI, are also associated with the same ALEC task force.  Poulson as an adviser and Williams on staff as the task force director. “ALEC has pushed for repealing the Affordable Care Act, has opposed Medicaid expansion, and has endorsed rolling back environmental regulations. Alec pushed the Trump administration to rescind federal findings that greenhouse gas emissions are harmful, a move that even ExxonMobil opposes.”\nThe Kansas Policy Institute’s mission statement indicates “We engage citizens and policy makers with research and information to enact public policy solutions that protect the constitutional right to freedom of all Kansans, give them greater access to better educational opportunities, and allow them to keep more of what they earn.”\nFunded by / Ownership\nThe Kansas Policy Institute is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that is held by a board of trustees and is funded through donations.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, KPI uses strong emotional language in their headlines such as “19 U.S. Senators promoting tyranny”. The Kansas Policy Institute utilizes credible right-center biased sources such as the Washington Times and Wall Street Journal, however they also utilize factually mixed sources such as the Daily Signal. Most articles on the website favor right wing causes such as endorsement of private/charter schools over public, lower taxes and government spending as well as receiving funding and endorsement by those who do not support the consensus of science regarding climate change. \nOverall, we rate Kansas Policy Institute Right biased based on story selection and policy issues that favor the right. We rate them Mixed for factual reporting based on use of other Mixed factual sources, connections to known groups that do not recognize the consensus of science on climate change and those that promote propaganda.

According to their about page the print magazine and website are corporately known as National Review, Inc. and is a wholly owned subsidiary of the National Review Institute (NRI) based in New York City.  In addition to the content published in its print version, the magazine’s web site covers articles, blogs, videos, podcasts, opinion pieces, conservative news, and commentary. \nWilliam F. Buckley Jr. appeared in a series of televised debates with Gore Vidal during the 1968 Republican National Convention and this resulted in him suing Vidal and Esquire Magazine due to Vidal calling Buckley “racist, anti-black, anti-semitic and a pro-crypto Nazi.” Buckley eventually settled with Esquire receiving a $115,000 payment and dropped his suit against Vidal. \nThe National Review promoted Barry Goldwater during the early 1960s and Reagan during the 80’s. E. Garrett Bewkes IV is the publisher of National Review. Richard Lowry is the Editor-in-Chief of National Review Magazine and the online Editor is Charles C. W. Cooke. The chairman is John Hillen and Lindsay Young Craig is the president. The full masthead can be viewed here.\nFunded by / Ownership\nThe National Review magazine and website are both owned by the National Review Institute. The National Review Institute was founded by William F. Buckley Jr. as a nonprofit and according to an article from The Nation the “National Review‘s biggest financial supporter, Roger Milliken was a Birch Society member. The Southern Poverty Law Center describes the John Birch Society as a conspiracist group, whereas the National Review describes Milliken as one of the “Right’s funding fathers”. According to Sourcewatch, The National Review Institute has received funding from the Charles G. Koch Foundation as well as grants from the right-wing Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation. The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reports the Bradley Foundation helps fund groups opposing climate regulation.\nAnalysis / Bias\nThe National Review Online, describes itself as “America’s most widely read and influential magazine and web site for conservative news, commentary, and opinion.”\nIn review, the National Review Online frequently uses loaded emotional wording in headlines that favor the right such as: Weapons of Mass Manipulation. This article was written by conservative pundit Michelle Malkin who has made false claims according to fact checkers. When reporting on President Trump the National Review offers a reasonable balance of pro-Trump and anti-Trump articles with slightly more favoring the President and his policies. National Review typically sources their information to known right leaning sources, but sometimes links to factually mixed sources such as PJ Media and the Daily Mail. Editorially, they endorse conservative policy and politicians, such as their endorsement of Ted Cruz during the 2016 Presidential Election. Finally, story selection always favors the right, while painting liberal policy negatively.\nA factual search reveals that in this article the National Review sourced the Daily Mail who falsely reported that NOAA manipulated climate data. This was later debunked by the person they were quoting (Dr. Bates). Further, the National Review did not include the actual statements that Dr. Bates made, which refute the Daily Mail and National Review’s claims of unverified and corrected data. Bates said there was “no data tampering, no data changing, nothing malicious.” “It’s really a story of not disclosing what you did,” Bates said in the interview. “It’s not trumped up data in any way shape or form.” FactCheck.org concluded that the National Review’s article was misleading.\nOverall, we rate the National Review Right Biased based on story selection that always favors the right and Mixed for factual reporting due to misleading claims and occasional use of poor sources.

According to the Washington Post since the election of Donald Trump OAN has become pro-Trump in coverage and a favorite news source for the President. The founder of OAN is Charles Herring who has said “Fox News has done a great job serving the center-right and independent audiences…But those who consider themselves liberal have a half dozen or more choices on TV each day from which to get their news.” OAN has been criticized for biased content that favors Donald Trump.\nFunded by / Ownership\nAccording to their about page “One America News Network is owned by Herring Networks, Inc. Herring Networks, Inc. is a family owned and operated, independent media company focused on providing high quality national television programming to consumers via its national cable networks.” Herring Networks is owned by Robert Herring Sr. who is a Republican donor. One America News is funded through advertising and television subscription fees.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, OAN is a far right biased news channel and website that uses moderately loaded words in headlines and articles such as this: Sen. Schumer Refuses To Back Down On Border Wall Funding. This article does not offer sourcing at all. In another article Senate Floats Restrictions On Detentions Of Illegal Aliens In Government Spending Bill, there is again a lack of sourced information.\nOne America News writes articles that are very short and easy to read. Their aim is to keep stories under 1 minute long. Story selection almost always favors the right and in particular President Donald Trump. An article in AdWeek describes how the owner of Herring Networks directs his newsroom to favor Trump: “According to internal emails, Herring has directed his channel to push Trump’s candidacy, scuttle stories about police shootings, encourage antiabortion stories, minimize coverage of Russian aggression, and steer away from the new president’s troubles, according to more than a dozen current and former producers, writers and anchors, as well as internal emails from Herring and his top news executives.”\nOAN has also promoted right wing conspiracies such as the Seth Rich Murder and that there was no evidence of chemical attacks in Syria.\nA factual search reveals a few failed fact checks by IFCN fact checkers.\n\nWould a Proposed Law ‘Ban the Bible’ in California? – FALSE\nIs an Increase in Recorded Crime in England and Wales Linked to ‘Radical Islamic Terror’? – MOSTLY FALSE\n\nOverall, we rate One America News Far right biased based on story selection that consistently favors the Right and Mixed for factual reporting due to promotion of conspiracies, lack of sourcing and a few failed fact checks.

Standpoint Magazine describes itself as “the only magazine that is dedicated to the defense of Western civilization, the values we have inherited from our Judaeo-Christian, classical, medieval, Renaissance and Enlightenment past.” Standpoint Magazine covers politics, religion, science, the arts and the humanities.\nFunded by / Ownership\nStandpoint Magazine is funded through online advertising, donations and subscription rates.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, Standpoint Magazine utilizes emotionally loaded language that favors the right in their headlines such as “Watchmen of the West “ and “The Great Betrayal: How Liberals Appease Islam.“\nRegarding US politics their word choices are pro-Trump. The following is a quote from an article: “President Trump may not be the ideal leader of the free world. But he understands what is at stake, he knows what must be done and he has the willpower to see it through. It is time for the high-minded to set aside their low expectations and judge Mr Trump by his actions rather than his words. There is method in his “madman diplomacy”. And it seems to be working.“\nOn national politics, the editorial opinion of Standpoint Magazine is conservative, usually supporting Theresa May. In this article they are drawing parallels between May and Thatcher with this quote: “Mrs May shares the same instinct: she sides with the little people who often struggle to survive in a global marketplace. Like Mrs Thatcher, she believes in a property-owning democracy, a nation in which hard work and solid achievement, rather than slick presentation or nifty networking, are rewarded. Like Mrs Thatcher, her parents were too poor to pay school fees.”\nWhen soliciting for donations, Standpoint utilizes conservative fears over terrorism and immigration as a threat to society: “In the era of global terrorism and uncontrolled migration, internal and external threats to our values and identity, that mission to preserve Western civilization has never been more necessary.”\nStandpoint does not source their information well, using quotes rather than hyperlinked or MLA formatted sourcing.\nOverall, we rate Standpoint Magazine Right Biased due to word and story choices that favor the Right and mixed factually due to poor sourcing.

This story, as an example, is sourced properly to credible mainstream media outlets. Story selection almost always favors the right on The Blaze and there is a heavy Christian bias as well.

Since The Blaze is run by Mercury, and not directly by Glenn Beck and his poor record with facts, we will rate The Blaze based on this one failed fact check.\nOverall, we rate The Blaze strongly Right Biased based on story selection that almost always favors the right and Mixed for factual reporting due to a failed a check and loaded emotional headlines.

Worthington was editor-in-chief at the Sun for 12 years and helped launched the Sun’s sister publication, the Ottawa Sun, in the late 1980s.\nThe Toronto Sun covers national news, politics, entertainment, sports and life. The Sun’s sport coverage is typically from the Associated Press and they also publish a daily Sunshine Girl, similar to British Tabloids. Currently Kevin Hann is the Deputy Editor and Jonathan Kingstone is the City Editor.\nFunded by / Ownership\nPostmedia is a Canadian news media company that owns daily newspapers in every major city from Montreal to Vancouver, which includes the National Post, Vancouver Sun, Calgary Herald, Edmonton Journal, Calgary Sun, Daily Herald-Tribune, Edmonton Sun, and The Winnipeg Sun.\nChatham Asset Management, a New Jersey based hedge fund holds a large equity stake in Postmedia and majority ownership of American Media Inc. which owns the National Enquirer. David Pecker, who owns American Media, Inc. joined the Postmedia board, and then resigned from the board of Postmedia in 2018, due to his involvement of hush payments on behalf of his “friends” including President Trump and Harvey Weinstein.\nAccording to the National Observer, PostMedia is in a downward spiral. After Postmedia announced a $1.4M loss for the last quarter of 2018, Paul Godfrey stepped down as CEO of the Postmedia Network and was replaced by Andrew MacLeod, as of 1/10/2019. Godfrey, will remain as executive chair. Godfrey was also criticized for cutting 800 full-time jobs across Postmedia in 2016, while earning an annual salary of $1.7 million. For a list of directors and upper management please see here.\nThe Toronto Sun is subscription based and revenue is primarily from print and digital advertising and subscription fees.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, the Toronto Sun reports news with emotionally loaded words and right leaning bias such as “Trudeau blunders will sink one-term wonder boy” and “Trudeau wages phony climate war against Ford.” The Sun also publishes bikini news such as “Will ‘duct-tape’ bikinis make a splash at the beach?” and their daily Sunshine Girls section, which is adapted from British tabloids.\nThe Sun re-publishes articles from credible sources such as the Associated Press, however they poorly source their news and when they do, they utilize their sister publications such as the Calgary Sun and rarely use hyperlinks.\nEditorially, CEO Paul Godfrey, ordered all 16 major Postmedia papers, including the Toronto Sun to endorse Stephen Harper of the Conservative Party, in the 2015 federal elections. Further, when it comes to science, The Sun casts doubt on human influenced climate change and thus rejects the consensus of science.\nA factual search reveals they have not failed an IFCN fact check.\nOverall, we rate the Toronto Sun, Right Biased based to story selection and editorial positions that favor the right and Mixed for factual reporting due to a lack of sourcing and scientific positions that do not align with the consensus of science.

According to Open Secrets Salem Media Group donates 100% to Republicans and right leaning PACS. The website is funded through online advertising.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, Townhall almost exclusively publishes news articles that favors conservatives and utilizes strongly loaded language such as this: Shove It, House Democrats: Another Trump-Russia Story Blows Up. This story is sourced to the left leaning Axios and right leaning Fox News. In another article with loaded language, by Rush Limbaugh’s brother David: Abortion Extremism Exposing Left’s Moral Contradictions, there is not a single source listed to support Mr. Limbaugh’s claims. \nIn general, Townhall presents story selection that almost always favors the right and uses negative wording to describe the left. There is little balance in story presentation with all information favoring the right without presenting a left perspective or counter argument. The opinion columnists associated with Townhall have poor fact check records such as Michelle Malkin, Ann Coulter and Ben Shapiro.

Almost all articles are grounded in science, however on some issues they do publish information that goes against the consensus of science. For example, in one article they report about Jenny McCarthy’s anti-vaccination crusade and while they did not endorse it, they also did not condemn it as pseudoscience. They take the same position with GMO, giving an equal platform to GMO doom studies. Since they report both sides and are not actually endorsing the non-consensus we are placing this in pro-science, but barely. (D. Van Zandt 7/27/2017)",

This source has also received an unproven claim by Snopes, which 21st Century Wire considers a questionable source. The website Fort Liberty has placed 21st Century Wire on it’s Fake News/Hoax list. 21st Century employs somewhat sensational headlines and does provide sourcing to attempt to support claims, however most are to themselves. The primary issue is that 21st Century publishes some questionable stories (see examples above) that are embedded among legitimate stories they publish. This can mislead the reader. \nA factual search reveals 21st Century Wire has a poor record with fact checkers. (D. Van Zandt 7/20/2016)\n(Dennis Kelly): 21st Century Wire is a conspiracy and fake news website with an extreme right bias. Additionally, their headlines are sensationalist and largely misleading.\nTheir stories are non-sourced, with no links except to their own stories, and are little more than loosely associated facts tied together with broad conjecture and innuendo. When trying to research some of their claims myself I could find no corroboration from a credible source. Ironically, they are currently in a self proclaimed war against “Fake News”, and the site features several stories on the subject. These war on “fake news” stories, as with their other content, contain little fact and lots of conjecture, with links to their other stories instead of links to external sources. I have provided a breakdown of one of their stories below.\nIn the story “The Mainstream Media Contortionists And Their Fake News Circus”. They begin by discussing Agnes Gruta, a journalist writing for La Presse, questioning the bias of Eva Bartlett, a journalist writing for Russia Today. While they admit Ms. Bartlett’s ties to RT, instead of addressing the possible bias of Ms. Bartlett they launch into an attack on Ms. Gruta instead. After this they delve into a broad attack of the purported bias of several other media outlets. There is also an addendum to the story by Ms. Bartlett herself, which is unusual in itself as rebuttals are usually published separately. The rebuttal purports to defend both herself and RT from the question of bias. It falls short however, as Ms. Bartlett, in her own words, admits that her work is biased:\n“…no corporate newspaper would publish what I wrote–not without heavy editing and censorship and changing of my chosen lexicon.” \nOn a personal note, I would have trouble trusting any news source that did not exercise at least some editorial control over what they publish, even an opinion piece. I also have trouble trusting a news source that only cites itself as corroboration of it’s “facts”. (D. Van Zandt 7/20/2016), (D. Kelley 2/15/2017) Updated (10/11/2018)",

Autism Speaks is an organization that raises tens of millions of dollars each year by hosting walks and star-studded events like an annual concert in Hollywood called Light Up the Blues. While Autism Speaks is one of the largest and most influential Autism groups they are not without controversy. Up until recently they promoted anti-vaccination based on the false notion that vaxx is a risk factor for autism. This goes 100% against the consensus of science. Thankfully, they have changed their position stating: “have not found a link between vaccines and autism,” and that they “strongly encourage parents to have their children vaccinated for protection against serious disease.” Another significant controversy is the board of Autism Speaks does not have a single person with autism representing the organization. This has caused persons with autism to form counter groups and protest this organizations leadership. Lastly, this organization sometimes promotes and funds non-evidence based therapies such as Floortime. Autism Speaks has a long track record of promoting Pseudoscience, but seems to be changing positions to be more evidence based. We will watch this source and move them accordingly if they demonstrate they are 100% science based. (D. Van Zandt 7/16/2017)",

In other words this site is desperately trying to capitalize on their followers.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn reporting news, Catholic Online has a strong right wing bias through story selection. For example, there is an article that celebrates President Trump’s decision to ban transgender persons from the military, citing moral obligation. In another article, they report about witches (liberals) gathering together to put a spell on Trump. Further, in this article they cite the source WND, which has a terrible track record with fact checkers. Lastly, Catholic Online publishes far right conspiracies such as Hillary Clinton being very sick and dying. Obviously, this is/was without evidence as she is healthy today. In this same article they also predicted that if Clinton had won the election terrible things would happen to the USA, presumably by God. \nOverall, we rate Catholic Online far right biased and Mixed for factual reporting based on the promotion of both conspiracy theories and pseudoscience.

There is irony in the term Christian Science as Christianity is a set of dogmatic beliefs, which is opposed to Science which is a method that strictly avoids dogma. In short, Christian Science advocates spiritual healing for medical conditions rather than proper medical treatment from a doctor.

            "notes": "History\nFounded in 2016, Disobedient Media is a news and opinion website with the tagline “Truth has no Bias.” The website was co-founded by Elizabeth Vos and William Craddick. Other than listing a few names associated with the website such as Adam Carter, who’s real name is Tim Leonard, the about page lacks information, such as what they do and/or a mission statement. It also does not disclose ownership and funding.\nFunded by / Ownership\nDisobedient Media does not clearly state ownership, though one would expect it is co-owned by the founders. Revenue appears to come from a Patreon donation account, however since there isn’t disclosure, we are uncertain of other revenue streams such as donations or sponsors.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, Disobedient Media publishes news and opinions with a strong right-wing bias through story selection and wording. There is significant use of loaded emotional language in headlines such as this: Opinion: In A Sane World Brenda Snipes Would Be In Prison, Not Reinstated and this It’s Been A Spectacularly Bad Month For Hillary Clinton: Here’s Why. In general, story selection is very negative when reporting on Democrats. When it comes to sourcing, Disobedient Media tends to source properly to mostly mainstream sources such as CNN, Fox News, Reuters, and the Daily Beast. However, they sometimes use conspiracy sources such as ZeroHedge and show support for Alex Jones, a very popular right-wing conspiracy theorist.\nA common theme of the website is focusing on leaks from Wikileaks and Guccifer 2.0, as well as criticism of the DNC and frequently attempting to deny Russian interference in the 2016 election. For example, in this article, Leaked State Department Emails Reveal Connection To Donald Jr. Meeting, they state “Some have claimed that the emails sent to Donald Jr. were intentionally worded to create a basis for a FISA request to surveil and unmask the Trump team.” The “some” who claimed this is the conspiracy website, ZeroHedge. The gist of the article is that Democrats (deep state) set up Don Jr. so that the Democrats can surveil and attack the Trump campaign. While that could be possible, there is zero evidence to support that claim, which makes it a conspiracy theory.\nDisobedient Media also publishes sensationalized headlines that do not match the story, such as this one: The Hollywood Complex At The Heart Of A Celebrity Child Sex Ring. This story is sourced to a Deadline article that describes how two sex offenders were found living in the 1,100 unit Oakwood Apartments, which is famous for having a lot of child actors living there. The Deadline article does not mention a sex ring and indicates that once the Apartment management discovered the two sex offenders, they were evicted. Further, the sex offenders did not commit a crime while living there. Disobedient Media then goes on to describe how “At least one resident of the Oakwood Apartment Complex was tied financially to the DEN child sex scandal which erupted in Hollywood in the aftermath of the dot-com burst. Actor Fred Savage is listed by multiple media outlets as having lived in the complex during his younger years. As reported yesterday by Disobedient Media, Savage was financially tied to DEN, though he was never accused of any sex offenses against minors.”\nAgain, there is no mention of a Sex ring anywhere in the Disobedient Media article, only in the headline. This is highly misleading click bait.\nSeveral media outlets have criticized Disobedient Media such as StopFake who state the Disobedient Media website “focuses on conspiracy theories, especially ones with a hint of pedophilia, together with posts attacking Hillary Clinton and her circle. In a Quartz article they state that the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research (DFR) has reported that William Craddick of Disobedient Media is a “distributor of fraudulent news stories.” The EU Observer has called Disobedient Media a “far-right US website.”\nFrom MBFC Researcher D. Kelley: Disobedient Media (DM) is, like many sensational sites, with a mix of a few facts peppered with conjecture, tenuous connections, and opinion. The stories are rife with hyperbole and biased wording intended to lead the reader to a conclusion that is often at odds with the actual facts provided. A good example of confirmation bias as opposed to responsible journalism. The stories on DM often point to either their own stories or similar stories on other right-wing and conspiracy sites.\nExample: DM is a staunch defender of Julian Assange, Wikileaks, and Guccifer 2.0. All of which have known and factually proven ties to Russia. In multiple articles they claim that Guccifer is not a Russian operative, or is being framed as such, when multiple factual sources, such as Ars Technica, have verified that not only did the files they shared came from Russian sources, but that Guccifer is actually a persona run by GRU, the Russian Intelligence Service.\nThe fact that DM includes some facts in their stories does not allay the sensational and conspiratorial spin they put on them. For this reason, DM is given a Conspiracy rating.\nOverall, we rate Disobedient Media a strongly right biased Conspiracy source, based on numerous examples of publishing information that is not conclusive or supported by evidence.

In 2012, Dr. Oz won James Randi’s “The Pigasus Award for Refusal to Face Reality” for his continued promotion of “quack medical practices, paranormal belief, and pseudoscience.” Further, Dr. Oz has promoted one of the worst purveyors of Pseudoscience, Joseph Mercola on his TV show.\nOverall, we rate Dr. Oz and DoctorOz.com as quackery level pseudoscience.

For example, in this article “ADHD is a FAKE Disease Invented by Big Pharma to Drug Children for Profit” they make the claim that ADHD is not a real health issue. While they may argue that the diagnosis is overused, the claim of it being fake is outright false. Like most clickbait pseudoscience websites they promote anti-vaccination propaganda and miracle cancer cures. Health Consciousness also utilizes very poor sources such as Natural News.\nOverall, this is a quackery level pseudoscience website with zero credibility due anonymity of ownership. (D.

Avocados are a great food source and loaded with plenty of nutrients, but this misleading headline does not match the article.

RealFarmacy has been routinely criticized for promotion of pseudoscience.\nFunded by / Ownership\nRealFarmacy is not transparent in its ownership. The website is funded through online advertising.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, RealFarmacy is a health news website that promotes both conspiracies and mostly pseudoscience. For example, many articles on this website promote anti-Vaccination propaganda such as this: Proof That It Is Actually Vaccinated People Who Are Spreading Communicable Disease. This article cites the credible Kaiser Health News and then turns to right wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones for analysis. RealFarmacy also publishes miracle cancer cures and prevention such as this: Manuka Honey: Improves Sleep, Boosts Immunity, Prevents Cancer, and Is a Natural Antibiotic. In case you were wondering, there isn’t evidence that Manuka Honey prevents cancer. Some other Pseudoscience topics you will find on RealFarmacy is humans being poisoned by chem trails, Fluoride alarmism and most commonly how deadly GMO’s are to humans. In general, this site disrespects science to such a degree it is less than non-credible.\nA factual search reveals to many failed checks to list.\nOverall, we rate RealFarmacy a Quackery level Pseudoscience website for the promotion of anti-vaccination propaganda, as well as dangerous miracle cures for cancer and a complete rejection of science on all levels.

For example, in this anti-vaccination article they use fear to persuade people not to vaccinate their children. The article attempts to convince people that more children are vaccine damaged in the USA than children in Syria have been damaged by chemical weapons. This article provides zero evidence to support that more children are injured by vaccines. There is not a single statistic from a reliable source to support this claim. They do however, claim that the Syrian bombing by the USA was a False flag operation. In fact, the article cites Natural News as it’s primary source for information. Natural News is a well know purveyor of pseudoscience, conspiracies and fake news. Within this same article they cite a source called CDC.news, which is meant to look like an official CDC page, but in fact is owned by Natural News for the purpose of discrediting the CDC. At least they put a disclaimer on the CDC.news page that it is not affiliated with the credible Centers for Disease Control.",

The website description reads: “This website is TRUTHBRARY.ORG. It is a collection of studies and investigations carried out by Dr. Billy Wayne Ruddick for the good of the American people. Now it the time when the American people must take back control of our media. The mainstream media cannot be trusted. They have there own agenda and are beholden to the whim of the deep state and the illuminati. We must take control of our facts and our truth. We must stand together to fight the dark forces of clintons and muslims and Godless peoples to stand strong for our religious freedom and hold forth for what is right in our country. Now is the time for the silent majority to come together ansd seek out our truth.” (note: spelling and grammar errors a part of the satire)\nFunded by / Ownership\nThe website is owned by Showtime.\nAnalysis / Bias\nTruthbrary is a satire website that mocks conspiracy and right wing fake news sites. A sample article headline reads: OBAMA IS A KENYAN.

The group’s membership as of 2016 is estimated at 500 members, in contrast to the AAP’s over 60,000 members. The organization’s view on parenting is at odds with the position of the American Academy of Pediatrics, which holds that sexual orientation has no correlation with the ability to be a good parent and to raise healthy and well-adjusted children. The American College of Pediatricians has been described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a “hate group“, with “a history of propagating damaging falsehoods about LGBT people”. (D.

AVFM is not so much a news source as an extended blog and echo chamber consisting primarily of op-ed style content decrying the feminist movement and touting what Mr. Elam and other contributors see as the persecution of males in a female run society. There is very little external sourcing for any of the content, and what source links I did follow led only to other anti-feminism opinion pieces and sites. The content is heavily weighted against feminism, and much of it revolves around the usual men’s rights issues. Divorce, custody, child support, men’s reproductive rights, etc. The site earns a Questionable rating based on the extreme bias of its men’s rights advocacy. (D. Kelley 3/4/2017)",

            "notes": "History\nLaunched in 1985, (CIS) was founded by John Tanton, a retired ophthalmologist who is also known as the founder of Numbers USA and the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), that is collectively known as the John Tanton Network. John Tanton believes maintaining an American culture requires “a European-American majority,” and according to the Southern Poverty Law Center he is a prominent figure in the white-nationalist movement.  \nThe Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) argues that John Tanton “played no part in its organization” as they state their founder is Otis L. Graham. According to his book, Debating American Immigration, 1882–present, Otis L. Graham was a chairman of the board for the The Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) (1985-1995).\nThe current Executive Director of the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) is Mark Krikorian. \n\nThe Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) describe themselves as an “an independent, nonpartisan research organization.” According to the Daily Beast, “CIS focuses on reduced legal immigration and supports increased detention and deportation of undocumented immigrants.” \nMembers of CIS have testified before congress over 100 times between 1995-2009 and in 2013, CIS played a major role in fighting the bipartisan immigration reform bill, with Mark Krikorian appearing in Congress to testify against the bill, claiming that “virtually all illegal aliens are guilty of multiple felonies.”\nAccording to Politifact, in 2016, Jason Richwine who is best known for his controversial doctoral dissertation entitled “IQ and Immigration Policy” began writing reports and blogs for CIS about immigration.\nIn 2016, The Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) published “79 immigration actions the next president can take” and according to a Daily Beast article they state “a number of the 79 items on the list composed by the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), have either been implemented or shown up in leaked draft proposals from the (Trump) administration.” \nFunded by / Ownership\nAccording to their website “The Center for Immigration Studies is an independent, non-profit research organization.” CIS does not disclose financial information on the website. However, one of the most prominent donors over the last 20+ years is the Colcom Foundation, established in 1996 by the late heiress Cordelia Scaife May. “According to Krikorian, Tanton hasn’t been involved with CIS for decades. However, Tanton was reportedly a close friend of Cordelia Scaife May, and that friendship lives on through the Colcom Foundation.” According to Inside Philanthropy, “Colcom’s top beneficiaries include every one of Tanton’s anti-immigration groups, including FAIR (over $18 million), NumbersUSA (over $17 million), Tanton’s Social Contract Press (over $10 million), and CIS (over $8 million).\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, the Center for Immigration Studies publishes news, research and studies related to the benefits of lower immigration levels. The blog offers news stories and opinions with the use of minimally loaded language such as this: Mexican Public Opinion on Immigration Tells Us Something About Our Own. This opinion piece centers around one source, a Mexican Newspaper that shows Mexicans are also opposed to immigrants from Central America. CIS also has a section for Op-Ed’s, which demonstrates a very strong right leaning bias with loaded emotional headlines such as this: Terror in Paradise: Trinidad and Tobago Is Now a Jihad Hotspot.  The Op-Eds are articles written by CIS staff that are published in a variety of right leaning publications such as PJ Media, National Review and the Questionable CNSNews, which has a terrible track record with fact checkers. \nCIS has also been accused of using poor methodology and cherry picking information. For example, in this strongly right leaning Cato Institute article dated 12/5/2018 “Center for Immigration Studies Overstates Immigrant, Non-Citizen, and Native Welfare Use” they report that “there are a few issues with the CIS report and an unsound methodological choice that they made that results in inflating the welfare use rates for immigrants and natives.” Cato also cited them in 2015 for exaggeration through cherry picking information.\nIn 2009, the SPLC pointed out four more studies that were debunked as being inaccurate, which you can read here.\nIn general, CIS publishes information meant to sway political leaders and the general voter that immigration is harmful to the USA, due to economic reasons and through claims of increased crime. However, in many cases CIS has published misleading information as evidenced above.\nOverall, we rate CIS a questionable source based on publishing misleading information (propaganda) regarding immigration, as well as ties either directly or indirectly to the John Tanton Network, who is a known White Nationalist.

Buckley Jr. CNS News is owned by Media Research Center (MRC), which is a conservative content analysis organization based in Virginia, founded in 1987 by L. Brent Bozell III. Bozell is a conservative columnist and author of four books, however, according to a Daily Beast article former employees claim that Bozell uses Tim Graham, Director of Media Analysis, as his ghostwriter. As a result, according to a Slate article, the Quad-City Times (Iowa) dropped Bozell’s column.\nMedia Research Center (MRC) states its mission is “to expose and neutralize the propaganda arm of the Left”. CNS News describe itself as a news source “for individuals, news organizations and broadcasters who put a higher premium on balance than spin and seek news that’s ignored or under-reported as a result of media bias by omission.” \nTerry Jeffery is Editor-In-Chief of CNS News and a complete list of staff for their parent company MRC can be found here, though some names were left off. For example, the Heritage Foundation states that Rebekah Mercer serves on the board of Media Research Center. Rebekah Mercer is the daughter of right-wing philanthropist Robert Mercer who heavily funded the Trump Campaign. \nFunded by / Ownership\nCNS News’ parent company is conservative media watchdog Media Research Center (MRC). According to charitynavigator.org ratings, Media Research Center (MRC) was awarded with an overall 2/4 star rating and with a 1 Star financial rating. A Politico article states that Bozell keeps the wealthy donor that helped start up Media Research Center secret. To this day that donor is still unknown.\nAccording to Sourcewatch, Media Research Center’s top donors are “Exxon Mobil and The Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, Inc. The foundation donated $1.65 million to Media Research Center between 2001 and 2010.” Further, Desmog Blog reports that “according to publicly available 990 forms, the MRC has received over $4.1 million from the oil money-backed Scaife Family and $7,494,000 from the Mercer Family Foundation.” Public Integrity reports that “Mercer has heavily funded ultra-conservative media outlets, such as Breitbart News and Brent Bozell’s Media Research Center.” The website is funded through donations and online advertising.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, CNS News consistently publishes news that favors the right and denigrates the left. Headlines and articles typically use moderate loaded wording such as this: Patrick Buchanan: Has the West the Will to Survive?. Within this article there is not a single link to an external source to support Mr. Buchanan’s commentary. Further, Pat Buchanan has a mixed track record with fact checkers. In another article they use questionable language when referring to liberals/welfare recipients as thugs. News stories also typically offer limited sourcing, with most hyperlinks directing back to older CNS stories. Editorially, CNS News advocates for a free market with limited regulations as well as promotion of climate change denialism as evidenced by their support for the Heartland Institute, which is a climate change think tank funded by the fossil fuel industry.\nA factual search reveals multiple failed fact checks for CNS News. Below is a list of failed fact checks either directly or indirectly tied to CNS News:\n\nIn Oregon, do 15-year-olds have complete control over sterilization? (False)\nDid the ACLU Complain That Trump Said ‘America’ Too Many Times in State of the Union? (False)\nDid Melania Trump Hire an Exorcist to Cleanse the White House of Obama ‘Demons’?

(False)\nShrub found in wild during California highway project transplanted for $148,000; move wasn’t paid for with Obama-approved economic stimulus aid (Mostly False)\n\nOverall, we rate CNS News Questionable based on extreme right wing bias, promotion of propaganda and numerous failed fact checks.

First, we look at wording and headlines. With these, Conservative Firing Line heavily uses emotional loaded words that are pro-right and anti-left. An example of a highly biased headline is as follows: Kid Rock triggers liberal snowflakes with true statement about life and hard work… The use of the words “triggers liberal snowflakes” is about as extreme as you can get using loaded words to emotionally sway readers. Next, we look at sourcing and factual reporting. In this area Conservative Firing Line makes an effort to source their information. However, there are many cases when they source to far right media sources or other questionable sources such as Uncle Sam’s Misguided Children, which has a poor track record with fact checkers. We could not find any evidence of Conservative Firing Line failing a fact check, but we did find them promoting unproven conspiracies such as the Clinton’s murdering multiple people. Within this article about the Clinton’s they source numerous questionable and conspiracy websites. For factual reporting, Conservative Firing Line is mixed due to misleading headlines and the use of poor sources. Our next criteria is balanced reporting. Does Conservative Firing Cover both sides of issues in their articles? The answer to that is a 100% no. They never do. This source is 100% biased for conservatives and against liberals. Lastly, we look at the website’s political affiliation and how they describe themselves. According to their about page “The Conservative Firing Line was established in May 2012 in an effort to inform, educate and inspire grassroots conservatives at all levels.” Therefore, we rate them right biased for political affiliation. Conclusion: Conservative Firing Line is questionable due to extreme right wing bias, sometimes utilizing poor sources and the promotion of right wing propaganda/conspiracies. (D.

            "notes": "History\nFounded in 2016, the Geller Report is the personal blog/website of Pamela Geller who is best known for her Anti-Islamic writings. According to her about page: “Pamela Geller is the founder, editor and publisher of The Geller Report and President of the American Freedom Defense Initiative (AFDI) and Stop Islamization of America (SIOA). She is a foremost defender of the freedom of speech against attempts to force the West to accept Sharia blasphemy laws, and against Sharia self-censorship by Western media outlets.”\nThe American Freedom Defense Initiative, is an anti-Muslim, pro-Israel American organization known primarily for its controversial, Islamophobic advertising campaigns. The group has been described as extremist and far-right. The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) lists SIOA as an anti-Muslim hate group.\nIn 2010, Pamela Geller began a controversial campaign to stop the construction of a mosque at the 9-11 ground zero site and in 2015, Ms. Geller proposed a drawing contest of cartoons depicting the prophet Muhammad, which is forbidding in Islam. This subsequently led to calls for Ms. Geller’s beheading. In 2017, David Wright, a Massachusetts man was sentenced to 28 years in prison for plotting to behead Geller whom the Islamic State militant group (ISIS) had urged its global support base to kill.\nFunded by / Ownership\nThe Geller Report is owned by Pamela Geller and is funded through advertising and donations.\nAnalysis / Bias\nThe Geller Report (GR) is a right wing source, run by Pamela Geller. GR is more of a personal blog than an actual news source, parroting the most extreme rhetoric of the right in general, and anti Muslim sentiment in particular. There is no attempt at factual reporting or presenting opposing views in the stories, and they are heavily biased in their wording and content. The sources GR uses in the stories are either from other extreme sources or misrepresented. For the heavy bias and extremism Geller Report is rated Questionable. (D. Kelley 6/19/2017)\nThe Geller Report frequently uses loaded language in their headlines such as this: Pamela Geller, Breitbart: CPAC Joins the Leftist Social Media Giants in Censoring Conservatives. The Geller Report typically publishes articles that Ms. Geller writes for other publications such as the questionable Breitbart, the right leaning American Thinker and the Alt Right blog of Milo Yiannopoulos, called Dangerous.\nIn general, the Geller Report routinely publishes highly negative stories against Islam. Ms. Geller has been called an anti-Muslim bigot and racist by Muneer Awad of the Council on American-Islamic Relations and has been labeled an “Anti-Islam Extremist” by the Southern Poverty Law Center and as “exhibiting anti-Muslim bigotry” by the Anti-Defamation League. Geller has dismissed the SPLC as an “uber left” organization.\nA factual search reveals a terrible track record with fact checkers.\n\nIn Parkland, Fla. “the mass murderer was immersed in Islamic and leftwing hate.” – PANTS ON FIRE\n“ISIS supporter tweeted at 10:34 a.m. Shooting began at 10:45 a.m.” in Chattanooga, Tenn. – FALSE\nDid Migrants Destroy a Car in Italy? – FALSE\nMuslims Declare December 24th an Islamic Holiday – FALSE\nWas former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn recently cleared by the FBI in the Russia probe?  – FALSE\n\nOverall, we rate the Geller Report Questionable based on extreme right bias, promotion of propaganda and conspiracies as well as extreme anti-Islamic views.

Much of the content also borders on conspiracy, only saved by the fact that most of the stories do have at least some basis in fact. Still, the obvious bias, lack of credible sourcing, and conspiracy overtones earn GJWHG a questionable rating. (D. Kelley 6/12/2017)",

However, at some point in 2018, they began publishing real stories that continue the tradition of denigrating religion. According to their about page, which is not linked on their website, they state “in 2015 God launched this Holy Website, TheGoodLordAbove.com.” This website does not have any names associated with it and the about page also continues to have this disclaimer “Thou shalt remember that The First Amendment protects satire as a form of free speech and expression. TheGoodLordAbove uses invented names in all of its stories, except in cases where public figures are being satirized.”\nFunded by / Ownership\nThe Good Lord Above does not disclose ownership, however they are affiliated with the Questionable source Woke Sloth. There is a copyright notice at the bottom of the website which lists Mysterious Ways LLC as the potential owner. According to Manta, Mysterious Ways LLC is a sole proprietorship based in Sacramento, California. The website does not appear to be funded through advertising.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, prior to 2018, Good Lord Above was a website that published fake satirical news stories that made fun of religion and the Christian Right. In 2018, they began publishing real news stories that are also denigrating to the right. A sample article headline reads: This Hilarious New Twitter Account Combines The Pope With Filthy Tweets. Some articles use highly loaded emotional language such as this: Scumbag Televangelist Pat Robertson Prays For God To ‘Throw Confusion’ Into Kavanaugh’s Alleged Victims. In general, articles typically reference tweets, with opinions that favor the left added in. Other articles consist of summaries from other sources such as: Raw Story, Daily Mail, Daily Dot, and the Friendly Atheist. Story selection always favors the left.\nA factual search reveals numerous failed fact checks. These failed fact checks occurred when Good Lord Above was a Satire website, however these fake stories appear to have been removed from the website.\nOverall, we rate the Good Lord Above Questionable based on a history of publishing fake news, as well as a lack of disclosure regarding ownership. (D. Van Zandt 10/6/2016) Updated (12/26/2018)\nCorrection: This website was previously listed as Satire, however they have changed format and are now moved to the Questionable list.",

            "notes": "History\nFounded in 1984, The Heartland Institute is an American conservative and libertarian public policy think tank that conducts work on issues including education reform, government spending, taxation, healthcare, education, tobacco policy, global warming, hydraulic fracturing, information technology, and free-market environmentalism. According to their about page “The Heartland Institute is one of the world’s leading free-market think tanks. It is a national nonprofit research and education organization based in Arlington Heights, Illinois. Its mission is to discover, develop, and promote free-market solutions to social and economic problems. The current President and CEO Tim Huelskamp, who is a member of the Republican Party was the U.S. Representative for Kansas’s 1st congressional district from 2011 to 2017. Huelskamp was rated the least bipartisan member of the House during the 114th Congress by The Lugar Center – McCourt school Bipartisan Index.\nThe Heartland Foundation has been criticized by some scientific organizations such as the Union of Concerned Scientists who said “Heartland has a long history of intentionally trying to confuse the public on behalf of corporate sponsors.” The Heartland Foundation responded by stating “This is absolutely false, malicious, and libelous. We have never compromised our principles or altered our research findings to satisfy or attract a corporate donor. UCS cites no evidence to back up this baseless claim.”\nFunded by / Ownership\nThe Heartland Institute is a nonprofit that has received funding in the past from notable right leaning institutions such as Exxon-Mobil, Charles G. Koch Foundation, and the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation. In the past, the Heartland Institute listed their donors, however they stopped this practice based on this reasoning: “For many years, we provided a complete list of Heartland’s corporate and foundation donors on this Web site and challenged other think tanks and advocacy groups to do the same. To our knowledge, not a single group followed our lead. However, critics who couldn’t or wouldn’t engage in fair debate over our ideas found the donor list a convenient place to find the names of unpopular companies or foundations, which they used in ad hominem attacks against us. Even reporters from time to time seemed to think reporting the identities of one or two donors–out of a list of hundreds–was a fair way of representing our funding or our motivation in taking the positions expressed in our publications. After much deliberation and with some regret, we now keep confidential the identities of all our donors.” Since they no longer list their donors, we are unable to determine their sources of funding.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, The Heartland Institute’s primary mission is to advocate for corporations and minimal regulations. For example, they have advocated on behalf of the tobacco industry claiming that “We argue that the (smoking) risks are exaggerated by the public health community to justify their calls for more regulations on businesses and higher taxes on smokers, and that the risk of adverse health effects from second-hand smoke is dramatically less than for active smoking, with many studies finding no adverse health effects at all. These positions are supported by many prominent scientists and virtually all free-market think tanks.” While Heartland may be able to find a few scientists and virtually all free-market think tanks (who aren’t scientists) to claim that second hand smoke is not very harmful, that goes completely against the consensus of the science.\nThe Heartland Institute is a leading supporter in climate change denial and when it comes to climate change information, they have made numerous false or misleading claims. They have also made false claims when it comes to other political issues. Here is a partial list of their numerous failed fact checks.\n\nWork requirements “have been proven to help impoverished families move from dependency to self-sufficiency.”  – MOSTLY FALSE\n“Model outputs published in successive IPCC reports since 1990 project a doubling of CO2 could cause warming of up to 6°C by 2100. Instead, global warming ceased around the end of the twentieth century and was followed (since 1997) by 19 years of stable temperature. Earth has not warmed significantly for the past 18 years despite an 8 percent increase in atmospheric CO2.” – INACCURATE\n“[climate models] systematically over-estimate the sensitivity of climate to carbon dioxide … and modelers exclude forcings and feedbacks that run counter to their mission.” – INCORRECT\n“Solar forcings are not too small to explain twentieth century warming. In fact, their effect could be equal to or greater than the effect of CO2 in the atmosphere.” – INCORRECT\n“Forward projections of solar cyclicity imply the next few decades may be marked by global cooling rather than warming, despite continuing CO2emissions.” – INCORRECT\n\nOverall, we rate the Heartland Institute Right Biased and Questionable based on promotion of anti-science propaganda, lack of transparency with funding, and more than 5 failed fact checks by IFCN fact checkers.

The group is opposed to all people in the USA who are not of white European decent. The mission of the group is to end immigration and achieve a 90% white America.

The blog is published by Lyndon Perry and according to his about page: “I am particularly critical of modern social justice movements such as feminism or Black Lives Matter, which I feel have been turning into a sort of narcissistic mental disorder over the years.”\nFunded by / Ownership\nI, Hypocrite is owned by Lyndon Perry and is funded through online advertising and donations via Patreon.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, I, hypocrite uses loaded words frequently in headlines and articles. For example, on their about page they refer to feminism as a “Narcissistic Mental Disorder.” All articles favor the right and use terms such as “snowflake” to describe those with liberal view points. In another article they use the racist symbol Pepe the Frog for no apparent reason other than to declare their position on race and gender equality. \nOverall, this is a Questionable source based on extreme right wing bias that also promotes men’s rights and uses racist symbolism.

Membership declined after Pierce’s death in 2002, and after a split in its ranks in 2005, the group has been barely functioning. At this point the National Alliance has merged and become National Vanguard, which holds the same policy positions. On the National Alliance website they publish stories directly from the National Vanguard that are white supremacist. The Southern Poverty Law Center has both groups classified as hate groups.

The current CEO of AMI is David Pecker who is a close personal friend to President Donald Trump. The tabloid is funded through magazine sales and advertising.\nAnalysis / Bias\nThe National Enquirer is well known for publishing outrageous and sometimes fake news stories. One could even say that they are the original fake news media outlet that profits by selling fake news. While most news on their website is not fake, the majority however, is sensationalized gossip that is not well sourced to credible information. A sample headline reads: Hillary Clinton: White House Dream Is Over! In this article they claim Clinton has 6 months to live, which is patently false. Here is the cover of the magazine:\n\nAccording to reporting by The Associated Press, during the 2016 United States Presidential election, stories that supported Donald Trump or attacked his rivals bypassed the newspaper’s standard fact checking process.  In general, stories regarding politics have a right wing bias in selection, especially as it relates to President Trump.\nA factual search reveals too many failed fact checks to list.\nOverall, we rate the National Enquirer Questionable based on the routine publishing of sensational or fake news stories.

The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) describes the group as “heavily armed extremists with a conspiratorial and anti-government mindset looking for potential showdowns with the government.” The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) lists the group’s founder as a known extremist and describes his announced plans to create localized militia units as “frightening”. According to the SPLC, the group espouses a number of conspiracy and legal theories associated with the sovereign citizen movement and the white supremacist posse comitatus movement. SPLC senior fellow Mark Potok describes the group as a whole as “really just an anti-government group who believe in a wild set of conspiracy theories.”",

His program frequently hosts a wide variety of content, including white nationalism, antisemitic theories, the paranormal, and philosophy, frequently from a far-right perspective. Guests on the show include white nationalists such as Richard B. Spencer and Andrew Anglin (owner and founder of the Daily Stormer).\nFunded By / Ownership\nThe website appears to be owned by Palmgren and is supported through subscriptions and pay per view.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, the website content contains strong anti-Muslim propaganda that showcases crimes committed by Muslims, while failing to report crimes by whites. The Southern Poverty Law Center calls Red Ice TV “a racist online radio broadcast.” Red Ice TV also interviews people who are conspiracy theorists such as L.A. Marzulli who has a false claim according to Snopes. \nIn summary we rate this a Questionable source based on an extreme alt-right bias that promotes white nationalist propaganda, conspiracy theories and is considered a hate group by the SPLC.

In 2013, via a presidential decree by Vladimir Putin, the radio station Voice of Russia and RIA Novosti news service was abolished and replaced by Rossiya Segodnya (Russia Today, not to be confused with RT). In 2014, Rossiya Segodnya (Russia Today) launched Sputnik and conservative news anchor, Dmitry Kiselyov was appointed as Director General of Rossiya Segodnya. Kiselyov is known for ultra conservative views and anti-gay comments.\nAccording to their about page, Sputnik describes itself as “The agency covers global political and economic news targeting an international audience.” Sputnik is based in Moscow. \nFunded by / Ownership\nSputnik is owned and funded by the Russian Government to promote Russia’s image abroad. The Sputnik news service produces over 1,500 news items daily and around the clock that are available to subscribers via the web terminal and mobile app. The website also serves online advertising.\nAnalysis / Bias\nSputnik is often accused of reporting ‘fake news, spreading misinformation and being a “Kremlin Propaganda Machine” by European and American media outlets. In 2017, the FBI launched an investigation into Sputnik for a potential violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA).\nIn review, Sputnik’s coverage regarding American Politics leans right and is consistently pro-Trump: “FBI Memo Implies Dossier on Trump Russian Collusion Funded by Clinton.” Sputnik also frequently uses strongly loaded emotional wording in headlines such as this: “WATCH: Philly’s New Year Parade Act Sees Trump, Putin Fight Over ‘Pee Tape’”\nSputnik routinely publishes articles that promote conspiracy theories such as those about the murder of Seth Rich, which fact checker Snopes has debunked. Sputnik also employs conspiracy theorists such as former Breitbart writer Lee Stranahan, who was hired as co-host of a radio show for Sputnik Radio, called “Fault Lines with Nixon and Stranahan”. Lee Stranahan also appears as a guest on Alex Jones’ Infowars program, which is famous for promoting outrageous right-wing conspiracies.\nWhen it comes to sourcing, Sputnik occasionally uses credible sources such as Reuters and CNN, however they also source to known conspiracy sites such as Infowars: “InfoWars Alex Jones Talks Brexit, Freedom of Speech in US, Political Correctness” and “Anonymous Exposes UK’s Hybrid Warfare Project”. Further, they frequently source to their own articles or they use large blocks of quotes.\nAccording to Google Fact Check Explorer, Sputnik has a very poor fact check record with 17 misleading or false claims. Below is a small sampling of their many failed fact checks:\n\n\n\n\nSputnik Falsely Blames India’s Sell-Off of US Securities on ‘Weaponization of the Dollar’ – FALSE\nSputnik Falsely Accuses UN of Supporting the White Helmet Disinfo Campaign Sputnik, Itself, Spreads – FALSE\nSputnik and Zvezda Falsely Claim Hitler’s Mein Kampf is more popular than Harry Potter in Latvia – FALSE\nIs the US Evacuating IS Members from Syria? – FALSE\nSputnik: Nevada Declared ‘State of Emergency’ Over Marijuana Shortage – FALSE\n\n\n\n\nOverall, we rate Sputnik Questionable based on frequent promotion of conspiracies and pro-Russian propaganda, as well as use of poor sources and numerous failed fact checks.

There isn’t evidence that Obama is plotting anything or thinks he is still President. The primary source for this story is Dick Morris and Infowars. A conspiracy takes a story such as Obama holding meetings each day and opines a much more sinister plot. This is a classic example of conspiracy and also propaganda. In order to keep this short I will just summarize that this website is very anti-Islam and openly declares them an enemy.

Trump Just Went On Twitter & EXPOSED Obama’s Sick Plan! **MAKE THIS GO VIRAL.” The words “Sick Plan” is a highly negative connotation that attempts to blame former President Obama for a judges decision, where there isn’t evidence to support it. Further, in this same article they copy and paste this quote as evidence of Obama’s “sick plan”: “JUDGE WILLIAM H. ORRICK, THE FEDERAL JUDGE IN SAN FRANSISCO (spelling error), WHO BLOCKED TRUMP’S ORDER THAT WOULD DEFUND SANCTUARY CITIES, IS AN OBAMA DONOR WHO GAVE $200,000 TO GET HIM ELECTED!” There isn’t a source for this quote, so we don’t know who said it or made that claim, in fact there isn’t any source at all for this news article other than some tweets from President Trump. Furthermore, Judge Orrick did not donate 200K to Obama. He helped raise 200K through fundraising and donated 30.8K to committees supporting Obama. Whether he donated to Obama or not is not evidence of a “sick plan” to block Trump. This is a classic clickbait tactic and promotion of propaganda. Also, according to fact checkers, Subject Politics  has made false claims here and here. Lastly, Subject Politics often references very questionable sources in their articles. For example, in the article entitled “TRUMP WAS RIGHT! Obama’s Top Adviser Just Leaked His WORST Nightmare,” Subject Politics uses Rush Limbaugh as a source to support their story.

SN uses extreme loaded language to convey emotion against the opposition and often only presents one side of the story. We also could not find an “About” page nor any information on the authors that would give insight into their mission. We have purposely not rated this website for left or right bias because they consistently rail against both if they are opposed to the Syrian State. Another factor in placing this source in the questionable category is the use of self linking. Self linking is when you link to other pages on your own website rather than outside credible sources. Based on extreme state bias, poor sourcing, and lack of information on the website, we rate this source questionable. We are not stating the information is false, just that each article should be fact checked for accuracy. We also recognize there is a strong propaganda campaign against the Syrian State by the opposition and it can be difficult to determine where the truth lies. (D. Van Zandt 5/24/2017)",

The Liberty Eagle, many times does not source their content and sometimes they source to questionable sources such as the Gateway Pundit and Mark Levin.

This obviously would impact all living Presidents, however the headline reads: Congress Wants To CANCEL Barack Obama’s Pension! Here Is Why.

False statement from article: “When the shootings continued to increase, Trump sent in more ATF agents at the beginning of February in an effort to reduce the gun crime epidemic that has overtaken the city.” – this is false.  They link to nothing however this news article the ATF denies that any new agents were sent or even Trump asking them too.    Lastly on this article it makes a statement which is not fact or lie but pure opinion.

That said, VR is not overly evangelical in its reporting. While the majority of the articles on VR focus on day to day matters concerning the Vatican, and the Pope, they do carry some non-religion world news as well. These non-religious articles are factual and presented, with a minimum of religious bias. In comparison to other religion based news sources VR is, on the whole, well written, informative, and well presented. Unfortunately, Media Bias / Fact Check judges news sources primarily on factual content and bias in reporting. \nOverall, faith based reporting, by its nature, contains an inherent bias, and presents information that is not verifiable by standard fact checking methods.

Although the website doesn’t list who runs the site, according to Whois the site’s registrant name is Annemiek Ploumen. According to Dutch magazine De Groene Amsterdammer (independent Dutch weekly news magazine published in Amsterdam), Erik De Vlieger is the financier and founder of the site, although he will not confirm or deny this publicly, while Daan van Seventer is the technical person. Voice of Europe doesn’t have an about page, however according to their twitter profile information they describe their content as “Conservative news network delivering you breaking news, uncensored articles and must-see videos.” \nFunded by / Ownership\nOwnership is not disclosed, however Erik De Vlieger appears to be the financier and the website is primarily funded through online advertising.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, Voice of Europe reports stories from European media and frames and spins them in a misleading way that always turns out negative for immigrants and the European Union: “Almost 98% of gang rapists in Sweden have a migrant background”, “Sweden reports highest number of murders in fifteen years” Voice of Europe also has a poor track record with fact checkers.\nVoice of Europe’s stories consist of sensational click bait headlines and focus on a variety of topics that are mostly anti-immigrant with emotionally loaded headlines and content such as “Swedish student suspended for telling the truth about migrant sex crimes.“  Voice of Europe frequently uses factually mixed sources such as Breitbart, Daily Mail, Gatestone Institute, and Sputnik News.\nOverall, this site is Questionable due to extreme right wing bias, promotion of propaganda, conspiracy theories and poor sourcing.

First, there isn’t an about page that describes who owns or what the objective of this site is. Second, virtually every headline uses loaded words that are sensationalized to induce clicking (Clickbait). Within the actual articles there is use of loaded words that are often sourced to left wing or questionable sources. Lastly, like most clickbait websites this one features popup ads that make the site difficult to navigate. In the review of articles we found that some stories are true and some are flat out misleading such as: http://walkwithher.com/trumps-latest-fec-disclosure-shows-trump-has-stock-in-company-that-made-bombs-used-in-syria, which both Snopes and this website has declared unproven/verified.
